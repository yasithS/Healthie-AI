Articles follow a\\nstandardized format that provides information at a\\nglance.

Aimed at achieving and main-\\ntaining good health rather than just eliminating disease,\\nthis approach has come to be known as alternative medi-\\ncine. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 includes a\\nnumber of essays on alternative therapies, ranging from\\ntraditional Chinese medicine to homeopathy and from\\nmeditation to aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on\\nalternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatmentsections for diseases and condi-\\ntions that may be helped by complementary therapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-\\nments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,\\nincluding professional medical guides and textbooks as\\nwell as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general\\nadvisory board, made up of public librarians, medical\\nlibrarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-\\nics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted\\nby category and sent to GEM2 medical advisors, certified\\nphysicians with various medical specialities, for review.\\nFinal selection of topics to include was made by the med-\\nical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and\\nother health care professionals. GEM2 medical advisors\\nreviewed the completed essays to insure that they are\\nappropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\n• Straight alphabetical arrangement allows users to\\nlocate information quickly.\\n• Bold-faced terms function as print hyperlinks that\\npoint the reader to related entries in the encyclopedia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\nIX\\nINTRODUCTION'),\n",

Combined with certain pain\\nrelievers or medicines for treating migraine headache ,\\ncaffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec-\\ntively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches.\\nAntihistaminesare sometimes combined with caffeine\\nto counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf-\\nfeine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions,\\nincluding breathing problems in newborns and in young\\nbabies after surgery.\\nDescription\\nCaffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate.\\nColas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine also\\ncomes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought without\\na prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include No\\nDoz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, and\\nVivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraine\\nheadaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAdults and children age 12 years and over\\n100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In\\ntimed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a day.\\nTimed-release forms should not be taken less than six\\nhours before bedtime.\\nChildren under 12 years\\nNot recommended.\\nOther considerations\\nAvoid taking too much caffeine when it is being\\ntaken as an over-the-counter drug. Consider how much\\ncaffeine is being taken in from coffee, tea, chocolate, soft\\ndrinks, and other foods that contain caffeine. Check with\\na pharmacist or physician to find out how much caffeine\\nis safe to use.\\nPrecautions\\nCaffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used\\nregularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri-\\nous sleep disorders, like insomnia.\\nPeople who use large amounts of caffeine over long\\nperiods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens,\\nthey have to use more and more caffeine to get the same\\neffects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.\\nIf the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with-\\ndrawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb-\\nbing headaches,fatigue, drowsiness, yawning, irritabili-\\nty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp-\\ntoms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid-\\ned. Then the symptoms usually disappear.\\nIf taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere\\nwith sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person from\\nfalling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.\\nThe notion that caffeine helps people sober up after\\ndrinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf-\\nfeine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi-\\nnation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to caffeine and\\nthus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri-\\ntability, nervousness,anxiety, and sleep problems.\\nC\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 625'),\n",

Caffeine can pass from a pregnant\\nwoman’s body into the developing fetus. Although there\\nis no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects in peo-\\nple, it does cause such effects in laboratory animals given\\nvery large doses (equal to human doses of 12–24 cups of\\ncoffee a day). In humans, evidence exists that doses of\\nmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day (about the amount of\\ncaffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee) may cause miscarriage or\\nproblems with the baby’s heart rhythm. Women who take\\nmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy\\nare also more likely to have babies with low birth\\nweights. Any woman who is pregnant or planning to\\nbecome pregnant should check with her physician before\\nusing caffeine.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk\\nand can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whose\\nmothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may be\\nirritable and have trouble sleeping. Women who are\\nbreastfeeding should check with their physicians before\\nusing caffeine.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Caffeine may cause\\nproblems for people with these medical conditions:\\n• peptic ulcer\\n• heart arrhythmias or palpitations\\nKEY TERMS\\nArrhythmia—Abnormal heart rhythm.\\nCentral nervous system —The brain, spinal cord\\nand nerves throughout the body.\\nFetus—A developing baby inside the womb.\\nPalpitation—Rapid, forceful, throbbing, or flutter-\\ning heartbeat.\\nWithdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or\\nmental symptoms that may occur when a person\\nsuddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has\\nbecome dependent.\\n• heart disease or recent heart attack (within a few\\nweeks)\\n• high blood pressure\\n• liver disease\\n• insomnia (trouble sleeping)\\n• anxiety or panic attacks\\n• agoraphobia (fear of being in open places)\\n• premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using caffeine with\\ncertain other drugs may interfere with the effects of the\\ndrugs or cause unwanted—and possibly serious—side\\neffects.\\nSide effects\\nAt recommended doses, caffeine can cause restless-\\nness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness,headache, light-\\nheadedness, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and upset\\nstomach. At higher than recommended doses, caffeine can\\ncause excitement, agitation, anxiety, confusion, a sensa-\\ntion of light flashing before the eyes, unusual sensitivity to\\ntouch, unusual sensitivity of other senses, ringing in the\\nears, frequent urination, muscle twitches or tremors, heart\\narrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, flushing, and convulsions.\\nInteractions\\nCertain drugs interfere with the breakdown of caf-\\nfeine in the body. These include oral contraceptives that\\ncontain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine\\n(Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet), and the\\ndrug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat alcoholism.\\nCaffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart\\nrhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal). Caf-\\nfeine may also interfere with the body’s absorption of iron.\\nAnyone who takes iron supplements should take them at\\nleast an hour before or two hours after using caffeine.\\nSerious side effects are possible when caffeine is\\ncombined with certain drugs. For example, taking caf-\\nfeine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine can\\nraise blood pressure. And very serious heart problems\\nmay occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase\\ninhibitors (MAO) are taken together. These drugs are\\nused to treat Parkinson’s disease , depression, and other\\npsychiatric conditions. Consult with a pharmacist or\\nphysician about which drugs can interact with caffeine.\\nBecause caffeine stimulates the nervous system,\\nanyone taking other central nervous system (CNS) stim-\\nulants should be careful about using caffeine.\\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n626\\nCaffeine'),\n",

The physician will check\\nto make certain the medicine is working as it should and\\nwill watch for unwanted side effects. People who have\\nhigh blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However,\\nthey should continue to see their prescribing physician\\neven when they feel well so that he can keep a close\\nwatch on their condition. They should also continue to\\ntake their medicine even when they feel fine.\\nCalcium channel blockers will not cure high blood\\npressure, but will help to control the condition. To avoid\\nthe serious health problems associated with high blood\\npressure, patients may have to take this type of medica-\\ntion for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the blockers\\nalone may not be enough. People with high blood pres-\\nsure may also need to avoid certain foods and keep their\\nweight under control. The health care professional who\\nis treating the condition can offer advice as to what mea-\\nsures may be necessary. Patients being treated for high\\nblood pressure should not change their diets without\\nconsulting their physicians.\\nAnyone taking calcium channel blockers for high\\nblood pressure should not take any other prescription or\\nover-the-counter medication without first checking with\\nthe prescribing physician, as some of these drugs may\\nincrease blood pressure.\\nSome people feel drowsy or less alert than usual\\nwhen taking calcium channel blockers. Anyone who\\ntakes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or do\\nanything else that might be dangerous until they have\\nfound out how the drugs affect them.\\nPeople who normally have chest pain when they\\nexercise or exert themselves may not have the pain when\\nthey are taking calcium channel blockers. This could lead\\nthem to be more active than they should be. Anyone tak-\\ning calcium channel blockers should therefore consult\\nwith the prescribing physician concerning how much\\nexercise and activity may be considered safe.\\nSome people get headaches that last for a short time\\nafter taking a dose of this medication. This problem usu-\\nally goes away during the course of treatment. If it does\\nnot, or if the headaches are severe, the prescribing physi-\\ncian should be informed.\\nPatients taking certain calcium channel blockers\\nmay need to check their pulse regularly, as the drugs may\\nslow the pulse too much. If the pulse is too slow, circula-\\ntion problems may result. The prescribing physician can\\nshow patients the correct way to check their pulse.\\nThis type of medication may cause the gums to\\nswell, bleed, or become tender. If this problem occurs, a\\nmedical physician or dentist should be consulted. To help\\nprevent the problem, care should be taken when brushing\\nand flossing the teeth. Regular dental check-ups and\\ncleanings are also recommended.\\nOlder people may be unusually sensitive to the\\neffects of calcium channel blockers. This may increase\\nthe chance of side effects.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines may develop problems if\\nthey also take calcium channel blockers.

Anyone who has\\nunusual symptoms after taking calcium blockers should\\ncontact the prescribing physician.\\nInteractions\\nCalcium channel blockers may interact with a num-\\nber of other medications. When this happens, the effects\\nof one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side\\neffects may increase. Anyone who takes calcium channel\\nblockers should not take any other prescription or non-\\nprescription (over-the-counter) medicines without first\\nchecking with the prescribing physician. Substances that\\nmay interact with calcium channel blockers include:\\n• Diuretics (water pills).

Its two main characteristics\\nare uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body\\nand the ability of these cells to migrate from the original\\nsite and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con-\\ntrolled, cancer can result in death.\\nDescription\\nOne out of every four deaths in the United States is\\nfrom cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause\\nof death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans are\\ndiagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 die\\nof cancer annually.\\nCancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of\\ncancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases are\\nseen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of all\\ncancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65\\nyears of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer,\\nlung cancer,colon cancer , breast cancer (in women),\\nand prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the\\nkidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and\\nblood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym-\\nphomas) are also included among the 12 major cancers\\nthat affect most Americans.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 631\\nCancer'),\n",

A\\ngene is a small part of DNA, which is the master mole-\\ncule of the cell. Genes make “proteins,” which are the\\nultimate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins that\\nallow our bodies to carry out all the many processes that\\npermit us to breathe, think, move, etc.\\nThroughout people’s lives, the cells in their bodies\\nare growing, dividing, and replacing themselves. Many\\ngenes produce proteins that are involved in controlling\\nthe processes of cell growth and division. An alteration\\n(mutation) to the DNA molecule can disrupt the genes\\nand produce faulty proteins. This causes the cell to\\nbecome abnormal and lose its restraints on growth. The\\nabnormal cell begins to divide uncontrollably and even-\\ntually forms a new growth known as a “tumor” or neo-\\nplasm (medical term for cancer meaning “new growth”).\\nIn a healthy individual, the immune system can rec-\\nognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them before they\\nget a chance to divide. However, some mutant cells may\\nescape immune detection and survive to become tumors\\nor cancers.\\nTumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A\\nbenign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing,\\ndoes not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and once it\\nis removed, it doesn’t usually recur. A malignant tumor,\\non the other hand, is cancer. It invades surrounding tissue\\nand spreads to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells\\nhave spread to the surrounding tissues, then, even after\\nthe malignant tumor is removed, it generally recurs.\\nA majority of cancers are caused by changes in the\\ncell’s DNA because of damage due to the environment.\\nEnvironmental factors that are responsible for causing\\nthe initial mutation in the DNA are called carcinogens,\\nand there are many types.\\nThere are some cancers that have a genetic basis. In\\nother words, an individual could inherit faulty DNA from\\nhis parents, which could predispose him to getting cancer.\\nWhile there is scientific evidence that both factors (envi-\\nronmental and genetic) play a role, less than 10% of all\\ncancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are known to\\nhave a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon cancer,\\novarian cancer, and uterine cancer. Besides genes, cer-\\ntain physiological traits could be inherited and could con-\\ntribute to cancers. For example, inheriting fair skin makes\\na person more likely to develop skin cancer, but only if\\nthey also have prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight.\\nThere are several different types of cancers:\\n• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the\\nlayers of cells covering the body’s surface and lining the\\ninternal organs and various glands). Ninety percent of\\nhuman cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can be\\nsubdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa-\\nmous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that\\ndevelop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car-\\ncinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin.\\n• Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the\\npigment cells (melanocytes).\\n• Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the\\nbody, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.\\n• Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called\\nleukemias and lymphomas respectively.\\n• Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-\\nhol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious\\nagents, family history, occupation, environment and pol-\\nlution.\\nAccording to the estimates of the American Cancer\\nSociety (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deaths\\nin 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.\\nAn additional one-third of the deaths will be related to\\ndiet and nutrition. Many of the one million skin cancers\\nthat are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due to\\nover-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun’s rays.\\nTobacco\\nEighty to ninety percent of the lung cancer cases\\noccur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a\\ncontributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract,\\nesophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver,\\nstomach, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists have\\nalso shown that second-hand smoke (or passive smoking)\\ncan increase one’s risk of developing cancer.\\nAlcohol\\nExcessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in\\ncertain cancers, such as liver cancer. Alcohol, in combi-\\nnation with tobacco, significantly increases the chances\\nthat an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynx\\nand esophageal cancers.\\nDiet\\nThirty-five percent of all cancers are due to dietary\\ncauses. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity has\\nbeen associated with cancers of the breast, colon, rectum,\\npancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries and uterus.\\nSexual and reproductive behavior\\nThe human papilloma virus, which is sexually trans-\\nmitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the cervix.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n632\\nCancer'),\n",

The\\nmost common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancers\\nassociated with them are shown in table form.\\nFamily history\\nCertain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter-\\nine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami-\\nlies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer “retinoblas-\\ntoma,” a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancer\\nknown as “early-onset breast cancer,” have been shown to\\nbe linked to certain genes that can be tracked within a\\nfamily. It is therefore possible that inheriting particular\\ngenes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers.\\nOccupational hazards\\nThere is evidence to prove that certain occupational\\nhazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam-\\nple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of\\nlung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of getting\\nbladder canceris associated with dye, rubber and gas\\nworkers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold miners\\nand arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnish\\nworkers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung,\\nbone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura-\\nnium miners.\\nEnvironment\\nRadiation is believed to cause 1–2% of all cancer\\ndeaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for a\\nmajority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiation\\nare x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclear\\nmaterial.\\nPollution\\nSeveral studies have shown that there is a well-\\nestablished link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina-\\ntion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk.\\nHowever, the main danger from pollution occurs when\\ndangerous chemicals from the industries escape into the\\nsurrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1%\\nof cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution.\\nCancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev-\\neral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp-\\ntoms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur\\ndue to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland.\\nAs the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves,\\norgans and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres-\\nsure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer.\\nDespite the fact that there are several hundred differ-\\nent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms,\\nthe ACS has established the following seven symptoms\\nas possible warning signals of cancer:\\n• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole\\n• a sore that does not heal\\n• persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat\\n• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere\\n• unusual bleeding or discharge\\n• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing\\n• any change in bowel or bladder habits\\nMany other diseases, besides cancer, could produce\\nthe same symptoms. However, it is important to have\\nthese symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especially\\nif they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-\\ned, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers\\nsuch as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms.\\nTherefore, it is important to undergo routine screening\\ntests such as breast self-exams and mammograms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina-\\ntion and a complete medical history.

To detect thyroid cancer, the doctor will\\nobserve the front of the neck for swelling. He may gently\\nmanipulate the neck and palpate the front and side surfaces\\nof the thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) to\\ndetect any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physical\\nexamination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodes\\nin the neck, under the arms and in the groin. Many illnesses\\nand cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes.\\nThe doctor may conduct a thorough examination of\\nthe skin to look for sores that have been present for more\\nthan three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritated\\npatches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the size\\nof a wart or a mole.\\nExamination of the female pelvis is used to detect\\ncancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In the\\nvisual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal dis-\\ncharges or the presence of sores. Then, using gloved\\nhands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organs\\nsuch as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormal\\nmasses. Breast examination includes visual observation\\nwhere the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness,\\ndiscoloration, or scaling.

The testicles are palpat-\\ned to identify any lumps, thickening or differences in the\\nsize, weight and firmness.\\nIf the doctor detects an abnormality on physical exam-\\nination, or the patient has some symptom that could be\\nindicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic tests.\\nLaboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),\\nblood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that may\\nindicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where the\\nphlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi-\\ncally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer. A\\nblood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually inexpen-\\nsive and risk-free. The blood sample is obtained by a lab\\ntechnician or a doctor by inserting a needle into a vein\\nand is relatively painless. Blood tests can be either spe-\\ncific or non-specific. Often times, in certain cancers, the\\ncancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor\\nmarkers) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres-\\nence of these tumor markers. However, with a few excep-\\ntions, tumor markers are not used for routine screening\\nof cancers, because several non-cancerous conditions\\nalso produce positive results. Blood tests are generally\\nmore useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat-\\nment, or in following the course of the disease and\\ndetecting recurrent disease.\\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-\\nsound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctors\\ndetermine the location of the tumor even if it is deep\\nwithin the body. Conventional x rays are often used for\\ninitial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap, pain-\\nless and easily accessible. In order to increase the infor-\\nmation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a dye\\n(such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrast\\nmedium to outline or highlight parts of the body.\\nThe most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,\\nwherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for micro-\\nscope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, the\\nbiopsy also provides information about the type of can-\\ncer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of the\\ncancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro-\\nvides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the gold\\nstandard of diagnostic tests.\\nScreening examinations conducted regularly by\\nhealthcare professionals can result in the detection of can-\\ncers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis,\\ntongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when treatment is\\nmore likely to be successful. Some of the routine screen-\\ning tests recommended by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy\\n(for colorectal cancer), mammography (for breast can-\\ncer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test\\n(for prostate cancer).

If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is\\nnot possible, then the treatment should be aimed at\\nrelieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as\\nlong as possible.\\nCancer treatment can take many different forms, and\\nit is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci-\\nsion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate\\ndepends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to\\nwhich it has already spread, the patient’s age, sex, gener-\\nal health status and personal treatment preferences. The\\nmajor types of treatment are: surgery, radiation,chemo-\\ntherapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone-\\nmarrow transplantation.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the\\nmost frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec-\\ntive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of\\nthe body.\\nSurgery can be used for many purposes.\\n• Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves\\nremoval of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical-\\nly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area.\\nAlong with the cancer, some part of the normal sur-\\nrounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer\\ncells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads\\nvia the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may\\nbe examined and sometimes they are removed as well.\\n• Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery\\ninvolves removal of an abnormal looking area that is\\nlikely to become malignant over time. For example,\\n40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer-\\native colitis, ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than\\nlive with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo-\\nple may choose to have their colons removed and\\nreduce the risk significantly.\\n• Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag-\\nnosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be\\nperformed by inserting a needle through the skin. How-\\never, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue\\nsample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.\\n• Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor\\nremoves as much of the cancer as possible, and then\\ntreats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo-\\ntherapy or both.\\n• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not\\nthe cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or\\nhas spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not\\nan option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be\\nso large that it may press on and block a portion of the\\nintestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and\\nvomiting. “Debulking surgery” may remove a part of the\\nblockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are\\ndependent on hormones, removal of the organs that\\nsecrete the hormones is an option. For example, in\\nprostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi-\\ncles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a\\nman may undergo an “orchiectomy” (removal of testi-\\ncles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a\\ntype of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries\\n(oophorectomy) will stop the synthesis of hormones\\nfrom the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone\\nin cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More\\noften, it is used in conjunction with surgery and\\nchemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter-\\nnal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the\\ntumor from outside the body.

Chemotherapeutic\\ndrugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra-\\nvenously, and may be given alone or in conjunction with\\nsurgery, radiation or both.\\nWhen chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia-\\ntion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or “neoadju-\\nvant chemotherapy.” An advantage of neoadjuvant\\nchemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not been\\nexposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera-\\nble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the size\\nof the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev-\\ner, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are\\nsevere. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant to\\nthe side effects of other treatments that follow such as\\nradiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera-\\npy is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance the\\neffectiveness of other treatments For example, after\\nsurgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy any\\ncancerous cells that still remain in the body.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s own immune sys-\\ntem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is\\nbeing intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet\\nwidely available to most cancer patients. The various\\nimmunological agents being tested include substances\\nproduced by the body (such as the interferons, inter-\\nleukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies and\\nvaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do\\nnot prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat\\npeople who already have the disease. Cancer vaccines\\nwork by boosting the body’s immune system and training\\nthe immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.\\nHormone therapy\\nHormone therapy is standard treatment for some\\ntypes of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow\\nfaster in the presence of particular hormones. These\\ninclude cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor-\\nmone therapy involves blocking the production or action\\nof these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumor\\nslows down and survival may be extended for several\\nmonths or years.\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nThe bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi-\\nties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bone\\nmarrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supply\\nand is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs\\nor radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroys\\nbone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthy\\ncells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrow\\ntransplant is the removal of marrow from one person and\\nthe transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the\\nsame person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans-\\nplantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to\\n“rescue” a patient, by allowing those with cancer to\\nundergo very aggressive therapy.\\nMany different specialists generally work together\\nas a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a\\nphysician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist\\nprovides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any other\\nnon-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation.\\nThe oncologist often serves as the primary physician and\\ncoordinates the patient’s treatment plan.\\nThe radiation oncologist specializes in using radia-\\ntion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performs\\nthe operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer. Gyne-\\ncologist-oncologists and pediatric-oncologists, as their\\ntitles suggest, are physicians involved with treating\\nwomen’s and children’s cancers respectively. Many other\\nspecialists may also be involved in the care of a cancer\\npatient. For example, radiologists specialize in the use of\\nx rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography scans (CT\\nscans), MRI imaging and other techniques that are used to\\ndiagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in disorders of\\nthe blood and are consulted in case of blood cancers and\\nbone marrow cancers. The samples that are removed for\\nbiopsy are sent to a laboratory, where a pathologist exam-\\nines them to determine the type of cancer and extent of\\nthe disease. Only some of the specialists who are involved\\nwith cancer care have been mentioned above. There are\\nmany other specialties, and virtually any type of medical\\nor surgical specialist may become involved with care of\\nthe cancer patient should it become necessary.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are a multitude of alternative treatments avail-\\nable to help the person with cancer. They can be used in\\nconjunction with, or separate from, surgery, chemothera-\\npy, and radiation therapy. Alternative treatment of cancer\\nis a complicated arena and a trained health practitioner\\nshould be consulted.\\nAlthough the effectiveness of complementary thera-\\npies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer pain has\\nnot been clinically proven, many cancer patients find it\\nsafe and beneficial.

However, isolation of the individual constituent\\nof vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer agents has\\nproven difficult. In laboratory studies,vitamins such as\\nA, C and E, as well as compounds such as isothio-\\ncyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-\\nflower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene found in carrots\\nhave been shown to protect against cancer. Studies have\\nshown that eating a diet rich in fiber as found in fruits\\nand vegetables reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise\\nand a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the risk\\nof endometrial, breast, and colon cancer.\\nCertain drugs, which are currently being used for\\ntreatment, could also be suitable for prevention. For\\nexample, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has been\\nvery effective against breast cancer, is currently being\\ntested by the National Cancer Institute for its ability to\\nprevent cancer.

In\\nthe United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk of\\ndeveloping cancer, and for women the risk is one in\\nthree. Overall, African-Americans are more likely to\\ndevelop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also\\n30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.\\nMost cancers are curable if detected and treated at\\ntheir early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affected\\nby many factors, particularly the type of cancer the\\npatient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which it\\nhas metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. In\\naddition, the patient’s age, general health status and the\\neffectiveness of the treatment being pursued are also\\nimportant factors.\\nTo help predict the future course and outcome of the\\ndisease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,\\ndoctors often use statistics. The five-year survival rates\\nare the most common measures used. The number refers\\nto the proportion of people with cancer who are expected\\nto be alive, five years after initial diagnosis, compared\\nwith a similar population that is free of cancer. It is\\nimportant to note that while statistics can give some\\ninformation about the average survival experience of\\ncancer patients in a given population, it cannot be used to\\nindicate individual prognosis, because no two patients\\nare exactly alike.\\nPrevention\\nAccording to nutritionists and epidemiologists from\\nleading universities in the United States, a person can\\nreduce the chances of getting cancer by following some\\nsimple guidelines:\\n• eating plenty of vegetables and fruits\\n• exercising vigorously for at least 20 minutes every day\\n• avoiding excessive weight gain\\n• avoiding tobacco (even second hand smoke)\\n• decreasing or avoiding consumption of animal fats and\\nred meats\\n• avoiding excessive amounts of alcohol\\n• avoiding the midday sun (between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M.)\\nwhen the suns rays are the strongest\\n• avoiding risky sexual practices\\n• avoiding known carcinogens in the environment or\\nwork place\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n637\\nCancer\\nA transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of two spindle\\ncell nuclei from a human sarcoma.

It is essential that the cancer surgeon (oncologic sur-\\ngeon) be experienced in the specific procedure.\\nRadiation therapy is commonly administered to\\napproximately 50% of cancer patients during the course of\\nillness. It can be used as the sole method of cure for tumors\\nin the mouth and neighboring structures in the oral cavity,\\nvagina, prostate, cervix, esophagus,Hodgkin’s disease ,\\nand certain types of cancer in the spinal cord and brain.\\nResearch and clinical trials have demonstrated that combi-\\nnation treatment is more effective than radiotherapy alone.\\nChemotherapy is curative for only a small percent-\\nage of cancers. It is most effective for choriocarcinoma,\\ncancer of the testis, some types of lymphomas, and can-\\ncer of skeletal muscles.\\nBiological therapies are a new and promising direc-\\ntion for cancer cures. Usually when cancer cells grow\\nthey manage to derive a blood supply that allows passage\\nof nutrients promoting continuation of abnormal cancer\\ngrowth. Research that focuses on destroying these blood\\nvessels is called angiogenesis. Cutting off the blood sup-\\nply has been shown to destroy tumors, since this stops\\nthe flow of essential nutrients required for cancer growth.\\nUse of certain growth factors can also stimulate self-\\ndestructive pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene\\ntherapy is directed towards inhibiting specific cellular\\nsignals that promote cancer cell multiplication.\\nPrecautions\\nSurgical resection requires an experienced surgeon,\\npreoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicate\\noperative technique. Care should be taken during the pro-\\ncedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, which\\ncan cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. If\\nmanipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areas\\nfor future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor can\\nalso help to avoid contamination of the surgical area.\\nEarly ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is an\\nessential component of a surgical cure.\\nRadiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning\\nand imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancer\\nfield while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis-\\nsue. This requires image monitoring and exact position-\\ning during radiation treatment sessions.\\nChemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal\\ncells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemical\\ndestruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues are\\ntypically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi-\\ncally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offer\\ncurative responses.\\nBiological therapies may cause patient toxicity\\nresulting in extensive side effects. This can occur since\\nthe optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above\\npatient tolerance.\\nDescription\\nSurgery\\nSurgical removal of the tumor must be performed with\\ncare and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula-\\ntion of the surgical field. Too much movement within the\\narea can cause cancer cell displacement into surrounding\\ntissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated,\\nthe tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per-\\nform an assessment concerning tissue removal around the\\ncancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspection\\nseem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancer\\ncells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of the\\noperative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surrounding\\narea are analyzed microscopically during the operation for\\ncell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) will\\nreveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areas\\nbordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help to\\ndecrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatment\\nmeasures, may provide a cure for certain cancers.\\nNot only can surgery be curative for some cancers,\\nbut it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessed\\nintraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guide\\nthe surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissue\\nremoval. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira-\\ntion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate)\\nfluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop-\\nsy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci-\\nmen; an incision biopsy removes a section from a large\\ntumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor.\\nThe surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymph\\nnodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor-\\ntant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. If\\nmicroscopic analysis determines the presence of cancer\\ncells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per-\\nform a more aggressive surgical approach.\\nRadiation therapy\\nSimilar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a\\nlocalized treatment. It involves the administration of ion-\\nizing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generates\\nreactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction of\\nDNA in local cells. There are three commonly used\\nradiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera-\\ntor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage rays\\nare of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv-\\ner higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat-\\ning skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energy\\nproducing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n639\\nCancer therapy, definitive'),\n",

Two\\ncommon routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapy\\ndelivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactive\\nmaterials within close proximity to the cancerous site.\\nTeletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using an\\nexternal beam machine.\\nChemotherapy\\nCurative chemotherapy usually requires multiple\\nadministrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy or\\nsystemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu-\\nlates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera-\\npeutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer.\\nChemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic\\n(malignant cancer which has spread to other areas\\nbeyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, since\\nvery few cancers are cured by systemic therapy.\\nBiologic therapy\\nBiologic therapies primarily function to alter the\\npatient’s response to cancer. These treatments are mostly\\ninvestigations and there are numerous research protocols\\nstudying the effects of biologic treatments. These proto-\\ncols usually have strict admission criteria that may\\nexclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat-\\nment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune\\ncells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells.\\nPreparation\\nFor all treatment modalities imaging studies, biopsy,\\nand constant blood analysis is essential before, during,\\nand after treatments. Surgical candidates should undergo\\nextensive pre-operative evaluation with imaging studies,\\nblood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, and\\nreadiness of staff for any potential complications and cell\\nbiopsy analysis.

These follow-up visits usually occur at spe-\\ncific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi-\\ncal patients may require closer observation during the ini-\\ntial post-operative period to avoid potential complica-\\ntions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered to\\nimprove appearance and restore function. Certain surgical\\nprocedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves-\\nsels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site.\\nRisks\\nSurgical risks\\nSurgical therapy can be both disfiguring and dis-\\nabling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affected\\nby radiotherapy.

Care can include\\nsurgery,radiation therapy , chemotherapy , sympto-\\nmatic treatments resulting from cancer, and side effects\\nof treatment. The primary objective of palliative care is\\nto improve the quality of remaining duration of life.\\nTreatment usually involves a combination of modalities\\n(multimodality approach) and numerous specialists are\\ntypically involved in the treatment planning process.\\nTherapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor-\\ndination with the treatment team.\\nSurgery can be utilized for palliation after careful\\nevaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these cases\\nmay reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality of\\nlife by relieving pain, alleviating obstruction, or control-\\nling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patients\\ncan also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh-\\nboring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reduce\\ntumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis-\\nease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drug\\nresistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat-\\nments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually given\\na second line medication or, if admission criteria are met,\\nthey may participate in an experimental research protocol.\\nPalliative treatments and terminal cancer in combination\\ncan cause many symptoms that can become problematic.\\nThese symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit-\\ning, difficulty in breathing,constipation, dehydration,\\nagitation, and delirium. The palliative treatment-planning\\ngoal focuses to reduce these symptoms.\\nPrecautions\\nSurgery for the purpose of tumor removal, biopsy, or\\nsize reduction is associated with postoperative pain and\\nlocal nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficult\\nto alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also\\nproduce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally,\\npatients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infections\\nlike herpes,pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and\\nwound abscess, all of which can cause severe pain. Pain\\nassociated with cancer and/or treatments can significantly\\nimpair the patient’s capabilities for performing daily tasks\\nand hence impair quality of life. These complications may\\nnegatively impact the patient’s psychological well being.\\nDescription\\nPain is one of the common symptoms associated with\\ncancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patients\\nhave pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannot\\nbe measured using technological approaches. Pain can be\\nassessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is rated\\nas no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facial\\nexpressions associated with various levels of pain. The\\nmajority of cancer patients experience pain as a result of\\ntumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, or\\nsoft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).\\nPain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles,\\nand internal structures such as the abdomen (cramping\\ntype pain associated with obstruction). Many patients also\\nexperience various types of pain as a direct result of fol-\\nlow-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo-\\ntherapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy).\\nPreparation\\nPatients are typically informed that their diagnosis is\\nterminal and treatments are directed to improve quality\\nof life for the remaining time and to minimize emotional\\nsuffering associated with pain.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n641\\nCancer therapy, palliative'),\n",

The World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad-\\nder. This treatment approach provides medication selec-\\ntions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain.\\nThe ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor-\\nphine) drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophin, or non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mild\\npain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con-\\nsistently administered medication(s). The “take as needed”\\napproach is not advised.

For example, cancer drugs may cause\\nnausea or vomiting. They may also destroy red or white\\nblood cells, resulting in a low blood count. Fortunately,\\nmany of these side effects can be relieved with other\\nmedicines.\\nDescription\\nDifferent kinds of drugs are used for different pur-\\nposes in supportive cancer therapy. To relieve nausea\\nand vomiting , a physician may prescribe dolasetron\\n(Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril) or ondansetron (Zofran).\\nDrugs called colony stimulating factors are used to help\\nthe bone marrow make new white blood cells to replace\\nthose destroyed by cancer treatment. Examples of colony\\nstimulating factors are filgrastim (Neupogen) and sar-\\ngramostim (Leukine). Another type of drug, epoetin\\n(Epogen, Procrit), stimulates the bone marrow to make\\nnew red blood cells. It is a synthetically made version of\\nhuman erythropoietin that is made naturally in the body\\nand has the same effect on bone marrow.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2642\\nCancer therapy, supportive'),\n",

This practice is controversial for several reasons.\\nUsing marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, is illegal\\nin most states. Also, most of the evidence that marijuana\\neffectively relieves nausea and vomiting comes from\\nreports of people who have used it, not from carefully\\ndesigned scientific studies. An oral medication that con-\\ntains one of the active ingredients of marijuana is avail-\\nable with a physician’s prescription and sometimes is\\nused to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing\\ncancer treatment. However, the drug, dronabinol (Mari-\\nnol), takes longer to work than smoked marijuana and\\nmay be difficult for patients with nausea and vomiting to\\nswallow and keep down.\\nIn 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued a\\nreport calling for more research into medical uses of\\nmarijuana. The panel of experts who wrote the report\\nalso recommended that researchers investigate other\\nways of getting the active ingredients of marijuana into\\nthe body, such as nasal sprays, skin patches and inhalers.\\nPatients who want to use marijuana to relieve side\\neffects of cancer treatment should talk to their physicians\\nand should carefully consider the benefits and risks, both\\nmedical and legal.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nsupportive cancer therapy.

Although colony stimulating factors help\\nrestore the body’s natural defenses, the process takes\\ntime. Getting prompt treatment for infections is impor-\\ntant, even while taking this medicine. Call the physician\\nat the first sign of illness or infection, such as a sore\\nthroat, fever or chills.\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking this medi-\\ncine is important. This will give the physician a chance to\\nmake sure the medicine is working and to check for\\nunwanted side effects.\\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\\nproblems if they take colony stimulating factors. In peo-\\nple who have kidney disease, liver disease, or conditions\\ncaused by inflammation or immune system problems,\\ncolony stimulating factors may make these problems\\nworse. People with heart disease may be more likely to\\nhave side effects such as water retention and heart\\nrhythm problems when they take these drugs. And people\\nwith lung disease may be more likely to have shortness\\nof breath. Anyone who has any of these medical condi-\\ntions should check with his or her physician before using\\ncolony stimulating factors.\\nEpoetin\\nThis medicine may cause seizures (convulsions),\\nespecially in people with a history of seizures. Anyone\\nwho takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or\\ndo anything else that might be dangerous if they have had\\na seizure.\\nEpoetin helps the body make new red blood cells, but\\nit cannot do its job unless there is plenty of iron in the\\nbody. The physician may recommend taking iron supple-\\nments or certain vitamins that help get iron into the body.\\nFollow the physician’s orders to make sure the body has\\nenough iron for this medicine to work. Do not take iron\\nsupplements unless they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn studies of laboratory animals, epoetin taken dur-\\ning pregnancy caused birth defects , including damage\\nto the bones and spine. However, the drug has not been\\nreported to cause problems in human babies whose\\nmothers take it. Women who are pregnant or who may\\nbecome pregnant should check with their physicians for\\nthe most up-to-date information on the safety of taking\\nthis medicine during pregnancy.\\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\\nproblems if they take this medicine. For example, the\\nchance of side effects may be greater in people with high\\nblood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a history\\nof blood clots. Epoetin may not work properly in people\\nwho have bone problems or sickle cell anemia.\\nDronabinol\\nThis medicine contains sesame oil and one of the\\nactive ingredients of marijuana.

Like\\nvaginal and oral candidiasis, it is an opportunistic disease\\nthat strikes when a person’s resistance is lowered, often due\\nto another illness. There are many diagnostic categories of\\ndeep organ candidiasis, depending on the tissues involved.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nV aginal candidiasis\\nMost women with vaginal candidiasis experience\\nsevere vaginal itching . They also have a discharge that\\noften looks like cottage cheese and has a sweet or bread-\\nlike odor. The vulva and vagina can be red, swollen, and\\npainful. Sexual intercourse can also be painful.\\nOral candidiasis\\nWhitish patches can appear on the tongue, inside of\\nthe cheeks, or the palate. Oral candidiasis typically\\noccurs in people with abnormal immune systems. These\\ncan include people undergoing chemotherapy for can-\\ncer, people taking immunosuppressive drugs to protect\\ntransplanted organs, or people with HIV infection.\\nDeep organ candidiasis\\nAnything that weakens the body’s natural barrier\\nagainst colonizing organisms—including stomach\\nsurgery, burns, nasogastric tubes, and catheters—can\\npredispose a person for deep organ candidiasis.

Patients with granulo-\\ncytopenia (deficiency of white blood cells) are particular-\\nly at risk for deep organ candidiasis.\\nDiagnosis\\nOften clinical appearance gives a strong suggestion\\nabout the diagnosis. Generally, a clinician will take a\\nsample of the vaginal discharge or swab an area of oral\\nplaque, and then inspect this material under a micro-\\nscope. Under the microscope, it is possible to see charac-\\nteristic forms of yeasts at various stages in the lifecycle.\\nFungal blood cultures should be taken for patients\\nsuspected of having deep organ candidiasis.

Canker sores appear as a\\nwhitish, round area with a red border. The sores are\\npainful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore is\\nabout one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa-\\nsionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious.\\nApproximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect-\\ned with recurring canker sores, and more women than\\nmen get them. Women are more likely to have canker\\nsores during their premenstrual period.\\nCanker sores are sometimes confused with cold\\nsores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.\\nThis disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters,\\ncan occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her-\\npes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and the\\ngums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth.\\nCold sores are infectious.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev-\\ner, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac-\\ntion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma to\\nthe affected areas from toothbrush scrapes,stress, hor-\\nmones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear\\nin response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling or\\nmildly painful itching sensation in the area where the\\nsore will appear. After one to several days, a small red\\nswelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitish\\ncolor with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a red\\nring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The main\\nsymptom is pain. Canker sores can be very painful, espe-\\ncially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue.\\nThey last for one to two weeks.\\nKEY TERMS\\nInflammation—A local reaction to tissue injury or\\ndamage, usually characterized by pain, swelling,\\nand redness.\\nSore—A wound, lesion, or ulcer on the skin.\\nUlcer—A site of damage to the skin or mucous\\nmembrane that is characterized by the formation\\nof pus, death of tissue, and is frequently accompa-\\nnied by an inflammatory reaction.\\nDiagnosis\\nCanker sores are diagnosed by observation of the\\nblister. A distinction between canker sores and cold sores\\nmust be made because cold sores are infectious and the\\nherpes infection can be transmitted to other people. The\\ntwo sores can usually be distinguished visually and there\\nare specific diagnostic tests for herpes infection.\\nTreatment\\nSince canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is\\nnot usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi-\\ncal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the\\nsores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes\\nspeeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can\\nhelp reduce the pain associated with canker sores.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at\\nhealing existing sores and preventing their recurrence.\\nSeveral herbal remedies, including calendula (Calendula\\nofficinalis ), myrrh ( Commiphora molmol ), and gold-\\nenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the\\ntreatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teas\\nmade from these herbs are applied directly to the sores.\\nThe tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the sores\\nwhen the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan-\\ndelion (Taraxacum officinale ) tea or capsules may help\\nheal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Since\\ncanker sores are often brought on by stress, such stress-\\nrelieving techniques as meditation , guided imagery ,\\nand certain acupressure exercises may help prevent\\ncanker sores or lessen their severity.\\nPrognosis\\nThere is no cure for canker sores.

Lactose intolerance, the\\ninability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespread\\nand affects up to 70% of the world’s adult population.\\nDescription\\nCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,\\nalong with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-\\nents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classified\\naccording to their structure based on the number of basic\\nsugar, or saccharide units they contain.\\nA monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and\\ncalled a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (the\\nform in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose\\n(found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced by\\nthe digestion of milk). These simple sugars are important\\nbecause they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Two\\nsimple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. The\\ndisaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (a\\nproduct of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),\\nand lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must\\nbe broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars so\\nthat they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-\\nrides are much more complex carbohydrates made up of\\nmany simple sugars, the most important of which are\\nglycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.\\nDigestion of sugars\\nDigestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to\\nthe stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along the\\nway, specific enzymes are needed to process different\\ntypes of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as a\\ncatalyst to produce chemical changes without being\\nchanged itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma-\\nltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha-\\nrides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car-\\nbohydrate intolerance.\\nTypes of intolerance\\nCarbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec-\\nondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defect\\npresent at birth or developed over time. The most common\\nis lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are caused\\nby a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap-\\npear when the disease is treated. These include protein\\ndeficiency,celiac disease, and some intestinal infections.\\nAdult lactose intolerance is the most common of all\\nenzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30–50 mil-\\nlion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth-\\nnic populations are affected more than others. Lactose\\nintolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri-\\ncans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native\\nAmericans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendants\\nof Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoples\\nusually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies in\\nenzymes other than lactase are extremely rare.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEnzymes play an important role in breaking down\\ncarbohydrates into forms that can pass through the intes-\\ntine and be used by the body. Usually they are named by\\nadding ase to the name of the substance they act on, so\\nlactase is the enzyme needed to process lactose. Cooked\\nstarch is broken down in the mouth to a disaccharide by\\namylase, an enzyme in the saliva. The disaccharides mal-\\ntose, sucrose, and lactose cannot be absorbed until they\\nhave been separated into simple sugar molecules by their\\ncorresponding enzymes present in the cells lining the\\nintestinal tract. If this process is not completed, digestion\\nis interrupted.\\nAlthough not common, a deficiency in the enzymes\\nneeded to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is some-\\ntimes present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes usually\\ndecrease naturally with age, but this happens to varying\\ndegrees. Because of the uneven distribution of enzyme\\ndeficiency based on race and ethnic heritage, especially\\nin lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to play a role\\nin the cause of primary carbohydrate intolerance.\\nDigestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi-\\ncal sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine), as\\nwell as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce the\\namount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients, treat-\\nment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may\\naffect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete lac-\\ntase, leading to intolerance.\\nThe severity of the symptoms depends on the extent\\nof the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling of\\nmild bloating to severe diarrhea. In the case of a lactase\\ndeficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the intes-\\ntine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normally\\npresent in the intestine. These bacteria produce gas,\\ncramping, bloating, a “gurgly” feeling in the abdomen,\\nand flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptoms\\nare diarrhea and a failure to gain weight. In an individual\\nwith lactase deficiency, gastrointestinal distress begins\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n649\\nCarbohydrate intolerance'),\n",

CO is a colorless, odorless,\\nhighly poisonous gas that is produced by incomplete\\ncombustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes,\\nfaulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarette\\nsmoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves,\\nkerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heaters\\nand gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim-\\nney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood to\\ncarry oxygen. The result is headache , nausea, convul-\\nsions, and finally death by asphyxiation.\\nDescription\\nCarbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has\\nbeen known as a toxic substance since the third century\\nB.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome.\\nToday it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in the\\nUnited States. According to the Journal of the American\\nMedical Association, 1,500 Americans die each year from\\naccidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten-\\ntional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 people\\nseek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover.\\nAnyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and\\nthe entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop-\\ning fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant woman\\nbreathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis-\\nease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect-\\ned. People such as underground parking garage atten-\\ndants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined area\\nare more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run a\\nhigher risk of inhaling CO.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNormally when a person breathes fresh air into the\\nlungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule called\\nhemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. This\\nallows oxygen to be moved from the lungs to every part\\nof the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complex\\nreaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen is\\nreleased. Because the oxygen binding process is\\nreversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over again\\nto pick up oxygen and move it throughout the body.\\nInhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this\\noxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes with\\noxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule. Hemo-\\nglobin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more than\\n200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen. Not only\\ndoes the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on to the CO\\nmuch more tightly, forming a complex called carboxyhe-\\nmoglobin (COHb). As a person breathes CO contaminat-\\ned air, more and more oxygen transportation sites on the\\nhemoglobin molecules become blocked by CO. Gradual-\\nly, there are fewer and fewer sites available for oxygen.\\nAll cells need oxygen to live. When they don’t get\\nenough oxygen, cellular metabolism is disrupted and\\neventually cells begin to die.\\nThe symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with\\nwhich they appear depend on the concentration of CO in\\nthe air and the rate and efficiency with which a person\\nbreathes. Heavy smokers can start off with up to 9% of\\ntheir hemoglobin already bound to CO, which they regu-\\nlarly inhale in cigarette smoke. This makes them much\\nmore susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupation-\\nal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab-\\nlished a maximum permissible exposure level of 50 parts\\nper million (ppm) over eight hours.\\nWith exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours, a\\nperson begins to experience headache, fatigue, nausea,\\nand dizziness . These symptoms correspond to 15–25%\\nCOHb in the blood. When the concentration of COHb\\nreaches 50% or more, death results in a very short time.\\nEmergency room physicians have the most experience\\ndiagnosing and treating CO poisoning.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n651\\nCarbon monoxide poisoning'),\n",

CEA is a substance which is normally\\nfound only during fetal development, but may reappear\\nin adults who develop certain types of cancer.\\nPurpose\\nThe CEA test is ordered for patients with known\\ncancers. The CEA test is most commonly ordered when a\\npatient has a cancer of the gastrointestinal system. These\\ninclude cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach (gastric\\ncancer), esophagus, liver, or pancreas. It is also used with\\ncancers of the breast, lung, or prostate.\\nThe CEA level in the blood is one of the factors that\\ndoctors consider when determining the prognosis, or\\nmost likely outcome of a cancer. In general, a higher\\nCEA level predicts a more severe disease, one that is less\\nlikely to be curable. But it does not give clear-cut infor-\\nmation. The results of a CEA test are usually considered\\nalong with other laboratory and/or imaging studies to fol-\\nlow the course of the disease.\\nOnce treatment for the cancer has begun, CEA tests\\nhave a valuable role in monitoring the patient’s progress.\\nA decreasing CEA level means therapy is effective in\\nfighting the cancer. A stable or increasing CEA level may\\nmean the treatment is not working, and/or that the tumor\\nis growing. It is important to understand that serial CEA\\nmeasurements, which means several done over a period\\nof time, are the most useful. A single test result is diffi-\\ncult to evaluate, but a number of tests, done weeks apart,\\nshows trends in disease progression or regression.\\nCertain types of cancer treatments, such as hormone\\ntherapy for breast cancer , may actually cause the CEA\\nlevel to go up. This elevation does not accurately reflect\\nthe state of the disease. It is sometimes referred to as a\\n“flare response.” Recognition that a rise in CEA may be\\ntemporary and due to therapy is significant. If this possi-\\nbility is not taken into account, the patient may be unnec-\\nessarily discouraged. Further, treatment that is actually\\neffective may be stopped or changed prematurely.\\nCEA tests are also used to help detect recurrence of a\\ncancer after surgery and/or other treatment has been com-\\npleted. A rising CEA level may be the first sign of cancer\\nreturn, and may show up months before other studies or\\npatient symptoms would raise concern.

Left-sided heart catheterization is\\nperformed by way of a catheter through an artery which\\ntests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function of\\nthe mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle.\\nPurpose\\nThe primary reason for conducting a cardiac\\ncatheterization is to diagnose and manage persons known\\nor suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con-\\ndition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually in\\nthe United States.\\nSymptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform-\\ning this procedure include:\\n• chest pain, characterized by prolonged heavy pressure\\nor a squeezing pain\\n• abnormal treadmill stress test\\n• myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack\\n• congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi-\\nnated from birth\\n• a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease\\n• a need to measure the heart muscle’s ability to pump\\nblood\\nTypically performed along with angiography, a tech-\\nnique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline\\nthe heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the\\nvisualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities\\nin the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi-\\nologist may assess the patient’s need and readiness for\\ncoronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive\\napproach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either\\nsurgically or with the use of a balloon (angioplasty).\\nWhen looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro-\\nscopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to\\nbe assessed:\\n• enlargement of the left ventricle\\n• ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood\\nvessel)\\n• narrowing of the aortic valve\\n• insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve\\n• the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the\\nother due to septal defects (also known as shunting)\\nPrecautions\\nCardiac catheterization is categorized as an “inva-\\nsive” procedure which involves the heart, its valves, and\\ncoronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm\\nor leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to\\nevaluate for the following conditions before considering\\nthis procedure:\\n• A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func-\\ntion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi-\\ntions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro-\\ncedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure.\\n• A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,\\nantibiotics may be given before the test to prevent\\ninflammation of the membrane which lines the heart\\n(endocarditis).\\nDescription\\nTo understand how a cardiac catheterization is able\\nto diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work-\\nings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as\\nthe body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its\\neveryday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made\\nup of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter-\\nies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy-\\ngen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in\\nany of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart’s\\nfunction. These abnormalities cause the heart’s blood\\nflow to decrease and result in the condition known as\\ncoronary artery diseaseor coronary insufficiency.\\nCatheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and\\ntreating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of\\nfluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may\\nresemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the\\nveins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can\\nmonitor a body’s various functions at each moment.\\nGenerally a test that lasts two to three hours, a\\npatient should expect the following prior to and during\\nthe catheterization procedure:\\n• A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient\\nto relax but remain conscious during the test.\\n• An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to\\nadminister medication. Electrodes will be attached to\\nthe chest to enable the painless procedure known as an\\nelectrocardiograph.\\n• Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the\\narm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by\\ninjecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is\\ninjected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick\\nstinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as\\nthe catheter travels through the blood vessel.\\n• After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery\\nsystem, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is\\ninjected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n656\\nCardiac catheterization'),\n",

The patient will be instructed\\nto rest in bed for at least eight hours immediately after\\nthe test. If the catheter was inserted into a vein or artery\\nin the leg or groin area, the leg will be kept extended for\\nfour to six hours. If a vein or artery in the arm was used\\nto insert the catheter, the arm will need to remain extend-\\ned for a minimum of three hours.\\nThe patient should expect a hard ridge to form over\\nthe incision site that diminishes as the site heals.

In cardiac catheterization, a\\nlong, fine catheter is used for passage through a\\nblood vessel into the chambers of the heart.\\nCoronary bypass surgery —A surgical procedure\\nwhich places a shunt to allow blood to travel from\\nthe aorta to a branch of the coronary artery at a\\npoint past an obstruction.\\nLeft anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)—\\nOne of the heart’s coronary artery branches from\\nthe left main coronary artery which supplies blood\\nto the left ventricle.\\nMitral valve—The bicuspid valve which is between\\nthe left atrium and left ventricle of the heart.\\nPulmonary valve—The heart valve which is posi-\\ntioned between the right ventricle and the opening\\ninto the pulmonary artery.\\nShunt—A passageway (or an artificially created pas-\\nsageway) that diverts blood flow from one main\\nroute to another.\\nTricuspid valve—The right atrioventricular valve of\\nthe heart.\\nA finding of impaired wall motion is an additional\\nindicator of coronary artery disease, aneurysm, an\\nenlarged heart, or a congenital heart problem.

Many deaths can be prevented by\\nprompt recognition of the problem and notification of the\\nemergency medical system (EMS), followed by early\\nCPR,defibrillation (which delivers a brief electric\\nshock to the heart in attempt to get the heart to beat nor-\\nmally), and advanced cardiac life support measures.\\nCPR must be performed within four to six minutes\\nafter cessation of breathing so as to prevent brain damage\\nor death. It is a two-part procedure that involves rescue\\nbreathing and external chest compressions. To provide\\noxygen to a person’s lungs, the rescuer administers mouth-\\nto-mouth breaths, then helps circulate blood through the\\nheart to vital organs by external chest compressions.\\nMouth-to-mouth breathing and external chest compression\\nshould be performed together, but if the rescuer is not\\nstrong enough to do both, the external chest compressions\\nshould be done. This is more effective than no resuscita-\\ntion attempt, as is CPR that is performed “poorly.”\\nWhen performed by a bystander, CPR is designed to\\nsupport and maintain breathing and circulation until\\nemergency medical personnel arrive and take over. When\\nperformed by healthcare personnel, it is used in conjunc-\\ntion with other basic and advanced life support measures.\\nAccording to the American Heart Association, early\\nCPR and defibrillation combined with early advanced\\nemergency care can increase survival rates for people\\nwith a type of abnormal heart beat called ventricular\\nfibrillation by as much as 40%. CPR by bystanders may\\nprolong life during deadly ventricular fibrillation, giving\\nemergency medical service personnel time to arrive.\\nHowever, many CPR attempts are not ultimately\\nsuccessful in restoring a person to a good quality of life.\\nOften, there is brain damage even if the heart starts beat-\\ning again. CPR is therefore not generally recommended\\nfor the chronically or terminally ill or frail elderly. For\\nthese people, it represents a traumatic and not a peaceful\\nend of life.\\nEach year, CPR helps save thousands of lives in the\\nUnited States. More than five million Americans annual-\\nly receive training in CPR through American Heart Asso-\\nciation and American Red Cross courses. In addition to\\ncourses taught by instructors, the American Heart Asso-\\nciation also has an interactive video called Learning Sys-\\ntem, which is available at more than 500 healthcare insti-\\ntutions. Both organizations teach CPR the same way, but\\nuse different terms. These organizations recommend that\\nfamily members or other people who live with people\\nwho are at risk for respiratory or cardiac arrest be trained\\nin CPR. A hand-held device called a CPR Prompt is\\navailable to walk people trained in CPR through the pro-\\ncedure, using American Heart Association guidelines.\\nCPR has been practiced for more than 40 years.\\nPerforming CPR\\nThe basic procedure for CPR is the same for all peo-\\nple, with a few modifications for infants and children to\\naccount for their smaller size.\\nPERFORMING CPR ON AN ADULT. The first step is to\\ncall the emergency medical system for help by telephon-\\ning 911; then to begin CPR, following these steps:\\n• The rescuer opens a person’s airway by placing the\\nhead face up, with the forehead tilted back and the chin\\nlifted.

The median nerve is responsible for both\\nsensation and movement in the hand, in particular the\\nthumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve is\\ncompressed, an individual’s hand will feel as if it has\\n“gone to sleep.”\\nWomen between the ages of 30 and 60 have the\\nhighest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has\\ndemonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig-\\nnificant cause of missed work days due to pain. In 1995,\\nabout $270 million was spent on sick days taken for pain\\nfrom repetitive motion injuries.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCompression of the median nerve in the wrist can\\noccur during a number of different conditions, particular-\\nly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid accu-\\nmulation throughout the body. Because the area of the\\nwrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar-\\nrow, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on the\\nmedian nerve. This pressure will ultimately interfere\\nwith the nerve’s ability to function normally.

Further-\\nmore, activities which cause an individual to repeatedly\\nbend the wrist inward toward the forearm can predispose\\nto carpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs which require\\nrepeated strong wrist motions carry a relatively high risk\\nof carpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type are\\nreferred to as “repetitive motion” injuries, and are more\\nfrequent among secretaries doing a lot of typing, people\\nworking at computer keyboards or cash registers, factory\\nworkers, and some musicians.\\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-\\nness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensation\\nover the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb,\\nforefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger.\\nSome individuals notice a shooting pain which goes from\\nthe wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers.\\nWith continued median nerve compression, an individual\\nmay begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif-\\nficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected\\nhand. Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by the\\nmedian nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller\\n(atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb.\\nUntreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually result\\nin permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or even paral-\\nysis of the thumb and fingers of the affected hand.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in\\npart by checking to see whether the patient’s symptoms\\ncan be brought on by holding his or her hand in position\\nwith wrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are often\\ntaken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres-\\nsure on the median nerve. A physician examining a patient\\nsuspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will perform a\\nvariety of simple tests to measure muscle strength and sen-\\nsation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing might\\ninclude electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity\\ntesting to determine the exact severity of nerve damage.\\nThese tests involve stimulating the median nerve with\\nelectricity and measuring the resulting speed and strength\\nof the muscle response, as well as recording speed of\\nnerve transmission across the carpel tunnel.\\nTreatment\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with\\nsplints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex-\\ning inward into the position which exacerbates median\\nnerve compression. Some people get significant relief by\\nwearing such splints to sleep at night, while others will\\nneed to wear the splints all day, especially if they are per-\\nforming jobs which stress the wrist. Ibuprofen or other\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be pre-\\nscribed to decrease pain and swelling. When carpal tun-\\nnel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids into\\nthe wrist to decrease inflammation may be necessary.\\nThe most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome\\nmay require surgery to decrease the compression of the\\nmedian nerve and restore its normal function. Such a\\nrepair involves cutting that ligament which crosses the\\nwrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room and\\ndecreasing compression. This surgery is done almost\\nexclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performed\\nwithout the patient having to be made unconscious. Care-\\nful injection of numbing medicines (local anesthesia) or\\nnerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics directly into the\\nnerve) create sufficient numbness to allow the surgery to\\nbe performed painlessly, without the risks associated with\\ngeneral anesthesia.

Most suffer-\\ners experience only moderate discomfort and find that\\ntheir symptoms clear up without any lasting harm after a\\nfew weeks or months. Professional medical treatment is\\nrarely needed.\\nDescription\\nCat-scratch disease (also called cat-scratch fever) is\\ncaused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which is\\nfound in cats around the world and is transmitted from\\ncat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered that large\\nnumbers of North American cats carry antibodies for the\\ndisease (meaning that the cats have been infected at some\\npoint in their lives). Some parts of North America have\\nmuch higher rates of cat infection than others, however.\\nBartonella henselaeis uncommon or absent in cold cli-\\nmates, which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but preva-\\nlent in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee,\\nwhere antibodies were found in 71% of the cats tested.\\nThe bacterium, which remains in a cat’s bloodstream for\\nseveral months after infection, seems to be harmless to\\nmost cats, and normally an infected cat will not display\\nany symptoms. Kittens (cats less than one year old) are\\nmore likely than adult cats to be carrying the infection.\\nBartonella henselae can infect people who are\\nscratched or (more rarely) bitten or licked by a cat. It\\ncannot be passed from person to person. Although cats\\nare popular pets found in about 30% of American house-\\nholds, human infection appears to be rare. One study\\nestimated that for every 100,000 Americans there are\\nonly 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/\\n100,000). It is also unusual for more than one family\\nmember to become ill; a Florida investigation discovered\\nmultiple cases in only 3.5% of the families studied.

The blister (which sometimes contains pus) often\\nlooks like an insect bite and is usually found on the hands,\\narms, or head. Within two weeks of the blister’s appear-\\nance, lymph nodes near the site of injury become swollen.\\nOften the infected person develops a fever or experiences\\nfatigueor headaches. The symptoms usually disappear\\nwithin a month, although the lymph nodes may remain\\nswollen for several months. Hepatitis,pneumonia, and\\nother dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihood\\nof cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health is\\nvery small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised\\npeople face the greatest risk of dangerous complications.\\nOccasionally, the symptoms of cat-scratch disease take\\nthe form of what is called Parinaud’s oculoglandular syn-\\ndrome.

The appearance of painful and\\nswollen lymph nodes is another reason for consulting a\\ndoctor.

To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the\\nevent of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is\\nallowed to heal before the cataract is removed from the\\nsecond eye.\\nThe presence of cataracts can mask additional eye\\nproblems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors\\nnor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such\\nconditions will continue to impair sight after cataract\\nremoval if they are not identified and treated, the eventu-\\nal outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out-\\ncome of other problems.\\nIn 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can\\ncontribute to the progression of age-related macular\\ndegeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the\\ndegeneration of the central part of the retina. According-\\nly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks of\\nthe loss of central vision, within four or five years,\\nagainst short-term improvement. When an ARMD\\npatient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon should\\nshield the retina against bright light to protect it from\\npossible light-induced damage during surgery and install\\nan intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet and\\nblue light, which seem to do the most damage.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAge-related macular degeneration (ARMD) —\\nDegeneration of the macula (the central part of the\\nretina where the rods and cones are most dense)\\nthat leads to loss of central vision in people over 60.\\nCataract—Progressive opacity or clouding of an\\neye lens, which obstructs the passage of light to\\nthe retina.\\nCornea—Clear outer covering of the front of the eye.\\nIntraocular lens—Lens made of silicone or plastic\\nplaced within the eye; can be corrective.\\nRetina—Innermost layer at the back of the eye,\\nwhich contains light receptors, the rods and cones.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular\\nand extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal of\\nboth the lens and the thin capsule that surround them.\\nThis type of surgery was common before 1980, but has\\nsince been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal\\nof the capsule requires a large incision and doesn’t allow\\ncomfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, people\\nwho undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long\\nrecovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses.\\nExtracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of\\nthe lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in\\nthe United States, over a million cataracts are removed\\nthis way.\\nThere are two methods for extracapsular cataract\\nsurgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. A\\ntiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made next\\nto the cornea (the eye’s outer covering), and an ultrasonic\\nprobe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces,\\nwhich are then removed by suction. When the lens is too\\nhard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use\\na different extracapsular technique requiring a larger\\nincision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made,\\nand the whole lens (without its capsule) is removed\\nthrough the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac-\\ntion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or\\nplastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in about\\nthe same location as the original lens.\\nThe surgery takes about 30–60 minutes per eye.\\nPreparation\\nPatients must have a pre-operation eye examination,\\nwhich will include ultrasound analysis to make sure the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n671\\nCataract surgery'),\n",

This cloudiness\\ncan cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventual\\nblindness.\\nDescription\\nThe human eye has several parts. The outer layer of\\nthe eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped cornea\\nand an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera help\\nprotect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, and\\nciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and the\\npupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris.\\nThe pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary body\\ncontains muscles that help in the eye’s focusing ability.\\nThe lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by a\\ncellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent,\\nelliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity\\nallows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. The\\nlens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of\\nZinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules,\\nwhich then change the shape of the lens. This process is\\ncalled accommodation—the lens focuses images to help\\nmake vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens and\\nchanges shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation\\nprocess becomes more difficult, making it harder to see\\nthings up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40\\nand continues until about age 65. The condition is called\\npresbyopia. It is a normal condition of aging, generally\\nresulting in the need for reading glasses.\\nThe lens is made up of approximately 35% protein\\nand 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes in\\nthe lens’ proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, water\\ncontent, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the\\nreasons for the formation of a cataract.\\nThe major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-\\ntex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of the\\nlens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule is\\nthe outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of the\\nlens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca-\\ntion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts).\\nThe density and location of the cataract determines the\\namount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the area\\nof the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif-\\nicantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edges\\nor side of the lens will create less of a visual problem.\\nCataracts in the elderly are so common that they are\\nthought to be a normal part of the aging process.\\nBetween the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance of\\nhaving a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and\\nolder are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senile\\nor age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes,\\nwith each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial-\\nly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remains\\nsmall or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changes\\nmay be minor.\\nCataracts that occur in people other than the elderly\\nare much less common. Congenital cataracts occur very\\nrarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection or\\ndisease in the mother during pregnancy are among the\\ncauses of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts may\\ndevelop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens or\\neye. Systemic illnesses, such as diabetes, may result in\\ncataracts. Cataracts can also occur secondary to other eye\\ndiseases—for example, an inflammation of the inner\\nlayer of the eye (uveitis) or glaucoma. Such cataracts are\\ncalled complicated cataracts. Toxic cataracts result from\\nchemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can also\\nresult from exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRecent studies have been conducted to try to deter-\\nmine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an\\neffect on the formation of cataracts in older people. The\\nresults have been mixed, with some studies finding that\\nthere is a connection and other studies finding none.\\nMuch interest has been focused on the use of antioxidant\\nsupplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidant\\nvitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene help\\nthe body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitamins\\nare marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients should\\nspeak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins.\\nSmoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in\\ncataract formation. Some studies have determined that a\\ndiet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataract\\nformation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidants\\nwill reduce the incidence. More research is needed to\\ndetermine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita-\\nmins have any connection to the formation of cataracts.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n673\\nCataracts'),\n",

However, only an ophthalmolo-\\ngist can perform cataract extraction.\\nCataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of\\nsymptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, and\\nby examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight into\\nthe pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of the\\nlens even before visual symptoms have developed. An\\ninstrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro-\\nscope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eye\\nand the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine the\\nlocation of the cataract.\\nSome other diagnostic tests may be used to deter-\\nmine if cataracts are present or how well the patient may\\npotentially see after surgery. These include a glare test,\\npotential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.\\nTreatment\\nFor cataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor\\nvisual changes, no treatment may be necessary. Continued\\nmonitoring and assessment of the cataract is needed by an\\nophthalmologist or optometrist at scheduled office visits.\\nIncreased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contact\\nlenses may be helpful. This may be all that is required if\\nthe cataract does not reduce the patient’s quality of life.\\nCataract surgery—the only option for patients whose\\ncataracts interfere with vision to the extent of affecting\\ntheir daily lives—is the most frequently performed surgery\\nin the United States. It generally improves vision in over\\n90% of patients. Some people have heard that a cataract\\nshould be “ripe” before being removed. A “ripe” or mature\\ncataract is when the lens is completely opaque. Most\\ncataracts are removed before they reach that stage. Some-\\ntimes cataracts need to be removed so that the doctor can\\nexamine the back of the eye more carefully. This is impor-\\ntant in patients with diseases that may affect the eye. If\\ncataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a time\\nshould be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eye\\nbefore the second cataract is removed, sometimes as early\\nas the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usu-\\nally given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patients\\nwill still need reading glasses. The overall health of the\\npatient needs to be considered in making the decision to\\noperate. However, age alone need not preclude effective\\nsurgical treatment of cataracts. People in their 90s can\\nhave successful return of vision after cataract surgery.\\nSurgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpa-\\ntient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and the proce-\\ndure lasts about an hour. Removal of the cloudy lens can\\nbe done by several different procedures. The three types\\nof cataract surgery available are:\\n• Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract\\nextraction is the most common. The lens and the front\\nportion of the capsule are removed. The back part of the\\ncapsule remains, providing strength to the eye.\\n• Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the\\nentire capsule are removed. This method carries an\\nincreased risk for detachment of the retina and swelling\\nafter surgery. It is rarely used.\\n• Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular extrac-\\ntion needs a very small incision, resulting in faster heal-\\ning. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the lens to break\\nit up into very small pieces which are then aspirated out\\nof the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist.\\nA replacement lens is usually inserted at the time of\\nthe surgery.

A folding IOL is\\nused when phacoemulsification is performed to accom-\\nmodate the small incision.\\nAntibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids to\\nreduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery. An eye\\nshield or glasses during the day will protect the eye from\\ninjury while it heals. During the night, an eye shield is\\nworn. The patient returns to the doctor the day after\\nsurgery for assessment, with several follow-up visits over\\nthe next two months to monitor the healing process.\\nPrognosis\\nThe success rate of cataract extraction is very high,\\nwith a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or better\\nmay be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extraction\\nwas performed, a secondary cataract may develop in the\\nremaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur one\\nto two years after surgery. Y AG capsulotomy is most often\\nused for this type of cataract. Y AG stands for yttrium alu-\\nminum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce-\\ndure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requires\\nno incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in the\\nremaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through.\\nIn a very small percentage (3–5%) of surgical cataract\\nextractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling of\\nthe cornea (edema), bleeding, retinal detachment , and\\nthe onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problems\\nmay occur one to two days, or even several weeks, after\\nsurgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea,\\nor pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately.\\nPrevention\\nPreventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes\\nfrom UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coating\\nto protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi-\\ncient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically,\\nUV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro-\\ntection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro-\\nteins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ-\\ning citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta-\\nbles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak-\\ning certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eye\\nexams may be necessary.

Barstow, RN\\nCatecholamines tests\\nDefinition\\nCatecholamines is a collective term for the hormones\\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Manufac-\\ntured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal\\nglands, these hormones are involved in readying the body\\nfor the “fight-or-flight” response (also known as the alarm\\nreaction). When these hormones are released, the heart\\nbeats stronger and faster, blood pressure rises, more blood\\nflows to the brain and muscles, the liver releases stores of\\nenergy as a sugar the body can readily use (glucose), the\\nrate of breathing increases and airways widen, and diges-\\ntive activity slows. These reactions direct more oxygen\\nand fuel to the organs most active in responding to\\nstress—mainly the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.\\nPurpose\\nPheochromocytoma(a tumor of the chromaffin\\ncells of the adrenal gland) and tumors of the nervous sys-\\ntem (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and gan-\\nglioneuromas) that affect hormone production can cause\\nexcessive levels of different catecholamines to be secret-\\ned. This results in constant or intermittent high blood\\npressure (hypertension ). Episodes of high blood pres-\\nsure may be accompanied by symptoms such as\\nheadache, sweating, palpitations, and anxiety. The cat-\\necholamines test can be ordered, then, to determine if\\nhigh blood pressure and other symptoms are related to\\nimproper hormone secretion and to identify the type of\\ntumor causing elevated catecholamine levels.\\nDescription\\nThe catecholamines test can be performed on either\\nblood or urine. If performed on blood, the test may\\nrequire one or two samples, depending on the physician’s\\nrequest. The first blood sample will be drawn after the\\npatient has been lying down in a warm, comfortable\\nenvironment for at least 30 minutes. If a second sample is\\nneeded, the patient will be asked to stand for 10 minutes\\nbefore the blood is drawn. Instead of a venipuncture,\\nwhich can be stressful for the patient, possibly increasing\\ncatecholamine levels in the blood, a plastic or rubber\\ntube-like device called a catheter may be used to collect\\nthe blood samples. The catheter would be inserted in a\\nvein 24 hours in advance, eliminating the need for needle\\npunctures at the time of the test.\\nIt may take up to a week for a lab to complete testing\\nof the samples. Because blood levels of catecholamines\\ncommonly go up and down in response to such factors as\\ntemperature,stress, postural change, diet, smoking, obe-\\nsity, and many drugs, abnormally high blood test results\\nshould be confirmed with a 24-hour urine test. In addition,\\ncatecholamine secretion from a tumor may not be steady,\\nbut may occur periodically during the day, and potentially\\ncould be missed when blood testing is used. The urine test\\nprovides the laboratory with a specimen that reflects cate-\\ncholamine production over an entire 24-hour period. If\\nurine is tested, the patient or a healthcare worker must col-\\nlect all the urine passed over the 24-hour period.\\nPreparation\\nIt is important that the patient refrain from using cer-\\ntain medications, especially cold or allergy remedies, for\\ntwo weeks before the test. Certain foods—including\\nbananas, avocados, cheese, coffee, tea, cocoa, beer,\\nlicorice, citrus fruit, vanilla, and Chianti—must be avoid-\\ned for 48 hours prior to testing. However, people should\\nbe sure to get adequate amounts of vitamin C before the\\ntest, because this vitamin is necessary for catecholamine\\nformation. The patient should be fasting (nothing to eat\\nor drink) for 10 to 24 hours before the blood test and\\nshould not smoke for 24 hours beforehand. Some labora-\\ntories may call for additional restrictions.

When someone with celiac disease eats\\nfoods containing gluten, that person’s immune system\\ncauses an inflammatory response in the small intestine,\\nwhich damages the tissues and results in impaired ability\\nto absorb nutrients from foods. The inflammation and\\nmalabsorption create wide-ranging problems in many\\nsystems of the body. Since the body’s own immune sys-\\ntem causes the damage, celiac disease is classified as an\\n“autoimmune” disorder. Celiac disease may also be called\\nsprue, nontropical sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy,\\nceliac sprue, and adult celiac disease.\\nCeliac disease may be discovered at any age, from\\ninfancy through adulthood. The disorder is more com-\\nmonly found among white Europeans or in people of\\nEuropean descent. It is very unusual to find celiac dis-\\nease in African or Asian people. The exact incidence of\\nthe disease is uncertain. Estimates vary from one in\\n5000, to as many as one in every 300 individuals with\\nthis background. The prevalence of celiac disease seems\\nto be different from one European country to another,\\nand between Europe and the United States. This may be\\ndue to differences in diet and/or unrecognized disease. A\\nrecent study of random blood samples tested for celiac\\ndisease in the US showed one in 250 testing positive. It is\\nclearly underdiagnosed, probably due to the symptoms\\nbeing attributed to another problem, or lack of knowl-\\nedge about celiac disease by physicians and laboratories.\\nBecause of the known genetic component, relatives of\\npatients with celiac disease are considered at higher risk\\nfor the disorder.\\nBecause celiac disease has a hereditary influence,\\nclose relatives (especially first degree relatives, such as\\nchildren, siblings, and parents) have a higher risk of\\nbeing affected with the condition. The chance that a first\\ndegree relative of someone with celiac disease will have\\nthe disease is about 10%.\\nAs more is learned about celiac disease, it becomes\\nevident that it has many variations which may not pro-\\nduce typical symptoms. It may even be clinically “silent,”\\nwhere no obvious problems related to the disease are\\napparent.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCeliac disease can run in families and has a genetic\\nbasis, although the pattern of inheritance is complicated.\\nThe type of inheritance pattern that celiac disease fol-\\nlows is called multifactorial (caused by many factors,\\nboth genetic and environmental). Researchers think that\\nseveral factors must exist in order for the disease to\\noccur. The patient must have a genetic predisposition to\\ndevelop the disorder. Then, something in their environ-\\nment acts as a stimulus, or “trigger,” to their immune sys-\\ntem, causing the disease to become active for the first\\ntime. For conditions with multifactorial inheritance, peo-\\nple without the genetic predisposition are less likely to\\ndevelop the condition with exposure to the same triggers.\\nOr, they may require more exposure to the stimulus\\nbefore developing the disease than someone with a\\ngenetic predisposition. Some of the things which may\\nprovoke a reaction include surgery, especially gastroin-\\ntestinal surgery; a change to a low fat diet, which has an\\nincreased number of wheat-based foods; pregnancy ;\\nchildbirth; severe emotional stress; or a viral infection.\\nThis combination of genetic susceptibility and an outside\\nagent leads to celiac disease.\\nEach person with celiac disease is affected different-\\nly. When food containing gluten reaches the small intes-\\ntine, the immune system begins to attack a substance\\ncalled gliadin, which is found in the gluten. The resulting\\ninflammation causes damage to the delicate finger-like\\nstructures in the intestine, called villi, where food absorp-\\ntion actually takes place. The patient may experience a\\nnumber of symptoms related to the inflammation and the\\nchemicals it releases, and/or the lack of ability to absorb\\nnutrients from food, which can cause malnutrition.\\nThe most commonly recognized symptoms of celiac\\ndisease relate to the improper absorption of food in the\\ngastrointestinal system.

Not all people\\nhave digestive system complications; some people only\\nhave irritability or depression. Irritability is one of the\\nmost common symptoms in children with celiac disease.\\nNot all patients have these problems. Unrecognized\\nand therefore untreated celiac disease may cause or con-\\ntribute to a variety of other conditions. The decreased\\nability to digest, absorb, and utilize food properly (mal-\\nabsorption) may cause anemia (low red blood count )\\nfrom iron deficiency or easy bruising from a lack of vita-\\nmin K. Poor mineral absorption may result in osteoporo-\\nsis, or “brittle bones,” which may lead to bone fractures.\\nVitamin D levels may be insufficient and bring about a\\n“softening” of bones (osteomalacia), which produces\\npainand bony deformities, such as flattening or bending.\\nDefects in the tooth enamel, characteristic of celiac dis-\\nease, may be recognized by dentists. Celiac disease may\\nbe discovered during medical tests performed to investi-\\ngate failure to thrive in infants, or lack of proper growth\\nin children and adolescents. People with celiac disease\\nmay also experience lactose intolerance because they\\ndon’t produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which\\nbreaks down the sugar in milk into a form the body can\\nabsorb. Other symptoms can include muscle cramps,\\nfatigue, delayed growth, tingling or numbness in the legs\\n(from nerve damage), pale sores in the mouth (called\\naphthus ulcers), tooth discoloration, or missed menstrual\\nperiods (due to severe weight loss).\\nA distinctive, painful skin rash, called dermatitis\\nherpetiformis, may be the first sign of celiac disease.\\nApproximately 10% of patients with celiac disease have\\nthis rash, but it is estimated that 85% or more of patients\\nwith the rash have the disease.\\nMany disorders are associated with celiac disease,\\nthough the nature of the connection is unclear. One type\\nof epilepsy is linked to celiac disease. Once their celiac\\ndisease is successfully treated, a significant number of\\nthese patients have fewer or no seizures. Patients with\\nalopeciaareata, a condition where hair loss occurs in\\nsharply defined areas, have been shown to have a higher\\nrisk of celiac disease than the general population. There\\nappears to be a higher percentage of celiac disease\\namong people with Down syndrome , but the link\\nbetween the conditions is unknown.\\nSeveral conditions attributed to a disorder of the\\nimmune system have been associated with celiac disease.\\nPeople with insulin dependent diabetes (type I) have a\\nmuch higher incidence of celiac disease. One source esti-\\nmates that as many as one in 20 insulin-dependent dia-\\nbetics may have celiac disease. Patients with other condi-\\ntions where celiac disease may be more commonly found\\ninclude those with juvenile chronic arthritis, some thy-\\nroid diseases, and IgA deficiency.\\nThere is an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma, a\\ntype of cancer, in individuals with celiac disease. Suc-\\ncessful treatment of the celiac disease seems to decrease\\nthe chance of developing lymphoma.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause of the variety of ways celiac disease can\\nmanifest itself, it is often not discovered promptly. Its\\nsymptoms are similar to many other conditions including\\nirritible bowel syndrome,Crohn’s disease , ulcerative\\ncolitis , diverticulosis, intestinal infections, chronic\\nfatigue syndrome , and depression. The condition may\\npersist without diagnosis for so long that the patient\\naccepts a general feeling of illness as normal. This leads\\nto further delay in identifying and treating the disorder. It\\nis not unusual for the disease to be identified in the\\ncourse of medical investigations for seemingly unrelated\\nproblems. For example, celiac disease has been discov-\\nered during testing to find the cause of infertility.\\nIf celiac disease is suspected, a blood test can be\\nordered. This test looks for the antibodies to gluten (called\\nantigliadin, anti-endomysium, and antireticulin) that the\\nimmune system produces in celiac disease. Antibodies are\\nchemicals produced by the immune system in response to\\nsubstances that the body perceives to be threatening. Some\\nexperts advocate not just evaluating patients with symp-\\ntoms, but using these blood studies as a screening test for\\nhigh-risk individuals, such as those with relatives (espe-\\ncially first degree relatives) known to have the disorder. An\\nabnormal result points towards celiac disease, but further\\ntests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Because celiac\\ndisease affects the ability of the body to absorb nutrients\\nfrom food, several tests may be ordered to look for nutri-\\ntional deficiencies. For example, doctors may order a test\\nof iron levels in the blood because low levels of iron (ane-\\nmia) may accompany celiac disease. Doctors may also\\norder a test for fat in the stool, since celiac disease pre-\\nvents the body from absorbing fat from food.\\nIf these tests above are suspicious for celiac disease,\\nthe next step is a biopsy (removal of a tiny piece of tissue\\nsurgically) of the small intestine. This is usually done by a\\ngastroenterologist, a physician who specializes in diagnos-\\ning and treating bowel disorders. It is generally performed\\nin the office, or in a hospital’s outpatient department. The\\npatient remains awake, but is sedated. A narrow tube,\\ncalled an endoscope, is passed through the mouth, down\\nthrough the stomach, and into the small intestine. A small\\nsample of tissue is taken and sent to the laboratory for\\nanalysis. If it shows a pattern of tissue damage characteris-\\ntic of celiac disease, the diagnosis is established.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n682\\nCeliac disease'),\n",

This may be easy for the doctor to prescribe, but dif-\\nficult for the patient to follow. For most people, adhering\\nto this diet will stop symptoms and prevent damage to the\\nintestines. Damaged villi can be functional again in three\\nto six months. This diet must be followed for life. For\\npeople whose symptoms are cured by the gluten-free diet,\\nthis is further evidence that their diagnosis is correct.\\nGluten is present in any product that contains wheat,\\nrye, barley, or oats. It helps make bread rise, and gives\\nmany foods a smooth, pleasing texture. In addition to the\\nmany obvious places gluten can be found in a normal\\ndiet, such as breads, cereals, and pasta, there are many\\nhidden sources of gluten. These include ingredients\\nadded to foods to improve texture or enhance flavor and\\nproducts used in food packaging. Gluten may even be\\npresent on surfaces used for food preparation or cooking.\\nFresh foods that have not been artificially processed,\\nsuch as fruits, vegetables, and meats, are permitted as\\npart of a GFD. Gluten-free foods can be found in health\\nfood stores and in some supermarkets. Mail-order food\\ncompanies often have a selection of gluten-free products.\\nHelp in dietary planning is available from dieticians\\n(healthcare professionals specializing in food and nutri-\\ntion) or from support groups for individuals with celiac\\ndisease. There are many cookbooks on the market specif-\\nically for those on a GFD.\\nTreating celiac disease with a GFD is almost always\\ncompletely effective. Gastrointestinal complaints and\\nother symptoms are alleviated. Secondary complications,\\nsuch as anemia and osteoporosis, resolve in almost all\\npatients. People who have experienced lactose intoler-\\nance related to their celiac disease usually see those\\nsymptoms subside, as well. Although there is no risk and\\nmuch potential benefit to this treatment, it is clear that\\navoiding all foods containing gluten can be difficult.\\nExperts emphasize the need for lifelong adherence to\\nthe GFD to avoid the long-term complications of this dis-\\norder. They point out that although the disease may have\\nsymptom-free periods if the diet is not followed, silent\\ndamage continues to occur. Celiac disease cannot be “out-\\ngrown” or cured, according to medical authorities.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibodies —Proteins that provoke the immune\\nsystem to attack particular substances.

However, about 10% of people with celiac disease\\ndevelop a cancer involving the gastrointestinal tract (both\\ncarcinoma and lymphoma).\\nThere are a small number of patients who develop a\\nrefractory type of celiac disease, where the GFD no\\nlonger seems effective. Once the diet has been thorough-\\nly assessed to ensure no hidden sources of gluten are\\ncausing the problem, medications may be prescribed.\\nSteroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to\\ntry to control the disease.

It is most commonly caused by\\nStreptococcus pyogenesor Staphylococcus aureus.\\nDescription\\nThe word “cellulitis” actually means “inflammation\\nof the cells.” Specifically, cellulitis refers to an infection\\nof the tissue just below the skin surface. In humans, the\\nskin and the tissues under the skin are the most common\\nlocations for microbial infection. Skin is the first defense\\nagainst invading bacteria and other microbes. An infec-\\ntion can occur when this normally strong barrier is dam-\\naged due to surgery, injury, or a burn. Even something as\\nsmall as a scratch or an insect bite allows bacteria to enter\\nthe skin, which may lead to an infection. Usually, the\\nimmune system kills any invading bacteria, but some-\\ntimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an infection.\\nOnce past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and\\nnutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. Disease-causing\\nbacteria release proteins called enzymes which cause tis-\\nsue damage. The body’s reaction to damage is inflamma-\\ntion which is characterized by pain, redness, heat, and\\nswelling. This red, painful region grows bigger as the\\ninfection and resulting tissue damage spread. An untreat-\\ned infection may spread to the lymphatic system (acute\\nlymphangitis ), the lymph nodes ( lymphadenitis ), the\\nbloodstream (bacteremia), or into deeper tissues. Celluli-\\ntis most often occurs on the face, neck, and legs.\\nOrbital cellulitis\\nA very serious infection, called orbital cellulitis,\\noccurs when bacteria enter and infect the tissues sur-\\nrounding the eye. In 50–70% of all cases of orbital cel-\\nlulitis, the infection spreads to the eye(s) from the sinus-\\nes or the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). Twen-\\nty-five percent of orbital infections occur after surgery on\\nthe face. Other sources of orbital infection include a\\ndirect infection from an eye injury, from a dental or\\nthroat infection, and through the bloodstream.\\nInfection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes\\nredness, swollen eyelids, severe pain, and causes the eye\\nto bulge out. This serious infection can lead to a tempo-\\nrary loss of vision, blindness, brain abscesses, inflamma-\\ntion of the brain and spinal tissues (meningitis ), and\\nother complications. Before the discovery of antibiotics,\\norbital cellulitis caused blindness in 20% of patients and\\ndeathin 17% of patients. Antibiotic treatment has signif-\\nicantly reduced the incidence of blindness and death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough other kinds of bacteria can cause cellulitis,\\nit is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (the\\nbacteria which causes strep throat) and Staphylococcus\\naureus. Streptococcus pyogenes is the so-called “flesh-\\neating bacteria” and, in rare cases, can cause a danger-\\nous, deep skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis.\\nOrbital cellulitis may be caused by bacteria which cannot\\ngrow in the presence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria). In\\nchildren,Haemophilus influenzae type B frequently\\ncauses orbital cellulitis following a sinus infection.\\nStreptococcus pyogenes can be picked up from a\\nperson who has strep throat or an infected sore. Other\\ncellulitis-causing bacteria can be acquired from direct\\ncontact with infected sores. Persons who are at a higher\\nrisk for cellulitis are those who have a severe underlying\\ndisease (such as cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease),\\nare taking steroid medications, have a reduced immune\\nsystem (because of AIDS, organ transplant, etc.), have\\nbeen burned, have insect bites, have reduced blood circu-\\nlation to limbs, or have had a leg vein removed for coro-\\nnary bypass surgery. In addition, chicken pox, human or\\nanimal bite wounds, skin wounds, and recent surgery\\ncan put a person at a higher risk for cellulitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of cellulitis are red-\\nness, warmth, pain, and swelling. The infected area\\nappears as a red patch that gets larger rapidly within the\\nfirst 24 hours. A thick red line which progresses towards\\nthe heart may appear indicating an infection of the lymph\\nvessels (lymphangitis). Other symptoms which may\\noccur include fever, chills, tiredness, muscle aches, and a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n684\\nCellulitis'),\n",

Some people also experience nausea,\\nvomiting, stiff joints, and hair loss at the infection site.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of orbital cellulitis are\\neye pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. The\\neye may bulge out and it may be difficult or impossible\\nto move. Temporary loss of vision, pus drainage from the\\neye, chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, and a general ill\\nfeeling may occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nCellulitis may be diagnosed and treated by a family\\ndoctor, an infectious disease specialist, a doctor who spe-\\ncializes in skin diseases (dermatologist), or in the case of\\norbital cellulitis, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). The\\ndiagnosis of cellulitis is based mainly on the patient’s\\nsymptoms. The patient’s recent medical history is also\\nused in the diagnosis.\\nLaboratory tests may be done to determine which\\nkind of bacteria is causing the infection but these tests\\nare not always successful. If the skin injury is visible, a\\nsterile cotton swab is used to pick up a sample from the\\nwound. If there is no obvious skin injury, a needle may\\nbe used to inject a small amount of sterile salt solution\\ninto the infected skin, and then the solution is withdrawn.\\nThe salt solution should pick up some of the bacteria\\ncausing the infection. A blood sample may be taken from\\nthe patient’s arm to see if bacteria have entered the\\nbloodstream. Also, a blood test may be done to count the\\nnumber of white blood cells in the blood. High numbers\\nof white blood cells suggest that the body is trying to\\nfight a bacterial infection.\\nFor orbital cellulitis, the doctor may often perform a\\nspecial x-ray scan called computed tomography scan\\n(CT). This scan enables the doctor to see the patient’s\\nhead in cross-section to determine exactly where the\\ninfection is and see if any damage has occurred. A CT\\nscan takes about 20 minutes.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is the only way to battle this\\npotentially life-threatening infection. Mild to moderate\\ncellulitis can be treated with the following antibiotics\\ntaken every four to eight hours by mouth:\\n• penicillins (Bicillin, Wycillin, Pen Vee, V-Cillin)\\n• erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab)\\n• cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex)\\n• cloxacillin (Tegopen)\\nOther medications may be recommended, such as\\nacetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\\nto relieve pain, and aspirin to decrease fever.\\nA normally healthy person is usually not hospital-\\nized for mild or moderate cellulitis. General treatment\\nmeasures include elevation of the infected area, rest, and\\napplication of warm, moist compresses to the infected\\narea. The doctor will want to see the patient again to\\nmake sure that the antibiotic treatment is effective in\\nstopping the infection.\\nPersons at high risk for severe cellulitis will proba-\\nbly be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring. Antibi-\\notics may be given intravenously to patients with severe\\ncellulitis. Complications such as deep infection, or bone\\nor joint infections, might require surgical drainage and a\\nlonger course of antibiotic treatment. Extensive tissue\\ndestruction may require plastic surgery to repair. In cases\\nof orbital cellulitis caused by a sinus infection, surgery\\nmay be required to drain the sinuses.\\nPrognosis\\nOver 90% of all cellulitis cases are cured after seven to\\n10 days of antibiotic treatment. Persons with serious dis-\\nease and/or those who are taking immunosuppressive drugs\\nmay experience a more severe form of cellulitis which can\\nbe life threatening. Serious complications include blood\\npoisoning(bacteria growing in the blood stream), meningi-\\ntis (brain and spinal cord infection), tissue death (necrosis),\\nand/or lymphangitis (infection of the lymph vessels).\\nSevere cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes can\\nlead to destructive and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.\\nPrevention\\nCellulitis may be prevented by wearing appropriate\\nprotective equipment during work and sports to avoid\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n685\\nCellulitis\\nThis person’s lower leg is swollen and inflamed due to cel-\\nlulitis.

The first recorded discussion of\\nthe concept of cell therapy can be traced to Phillippus\\nAureolus Paracelsus (1493–1541), a German-Swiss physi-\\ncian and alchemist who wrote in his Der grossen Wun-\\ndartzney (“Great Surgery Book”) in 1536 that “the heart\\nheals the heart, lung heals the lung, spleen heals the spleen;\\nlike cures like.” Paracelsus and many of his contemporaries\\nagreed that the best way to treat an illness was to use living\\ntissue to restore the ailing. In 1667, at a laboratory in the\\npalace of Louis XIV , Jean-Baptiste Denis (1640–1704)\\nattempted to transfuse blood from a calf into a mentally ill\\npatient—and since blood transfusion is, in effect, a form\\nof cell therapy, this could be the first documented case of\\nthis procedure. However, the first recorded attempt at non-\\nblood cellular therapy occurred in 1912 when German\\nphysicians attempted to treat children with hypothy-\\nroidism, or an underactive thyroid, with thyroid cells.\\nIn 1931, Dr. Paul Niehans (1882–1971), a Swiss\\nphysician, became known as “the father of cell therapy”\\nquite by chance. After a surgical accident by a colleague,\\nNiehans attempted to transplant a patient’s severely dam-\\naged parathyroid glands with those of a steer. When the\\npatient began to rapidly deteriorate before the transplant\\ncould take place, Niehans decided to dice the steer’s\\nparathyroid gland into fine pieces, mix the pieces in a\\nsaline solution, and inject them into the dying patient.\\nImmediately, the patient began to improve and, in fact,\\nlived for another 30 years.\\nCell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant\\nwhich has also been referred to as “live cell therapy,”\\n“xenotransplant therapy,” “cellular suspensions,” “glan-\\ndular therapy,” or “fresh cell therapy.” The procedure\\ninvolves the injection of either whole fetal xenogenic\\n(animal) cells (e.g., from sheep, cows, pigs, and sharks)\\nor cell extracts from human tissue. The latter is known as\\nautologous cell therapy if the cells are extracted from and\\ntransplanted back into the same patient. Several different\\ntypes of cells can be administered simultaneously.\\nJust as Paracelsus’ theory of “like cures like,” the\\ntypes of cells that are administered correspond in some\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n686\\nCell therapy'),\n",

In other words, the cells are not species specif-\\nic, but only organ specific. Supporters of cellular treat-\\nment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue con-\\ntain active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins ,\\nminerals, hormones, or enzymes.\\nSwedish researchers have successfully transplanted\\nhuman fetal stem cells into human recipients, and the\\nprocedure is being investigated further as a possible\\ntreatment for repairing brain cells in Parkinson’s\\npatients. However, because the cells used in these appli-\\ncations must be harvested from aborted human fetuses,\\nthere is an ethical debate over their use.\\nCurrently, applications of cell therapy in the United\\nStates is still in the research, experimental, and clinical\\ntrial stages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\nhas approved the use of one cellular therapy technique\\nfor repairing damaged knee joints.

Another procedure uses fresh-\\nly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processed\\nand suspended in a saline solution.

When\\nwar erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital in\\nBelgrade, Yugoslavia.

CNS\\ndepressants include a wide range of drugs such as alcohol,\\nnarcotics, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal), ben-\\nzodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax),\\nchloral hydrate, and methaqualone (Quaaludes), as well as\\nnewer CNS depressants developed in the 1990s, such as\\nBuspirone (Buspar) and Zolpidem (Ambien), which are\\nthought to have the fewest sideeffects. Most CNS depres-\\nsants activate a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobu-\\ntyric acid (GABA), which helps decrease brain activity.\\nStreet names for CNS depressants include Reds, Yellows,\\nBlues, Ludes, Barbs, and Downers.\\nPrecautions\\nMost CNS depressants have the potential to be physi-\\ncally and psychologically addictive. Alcohol is the most\\nwidely abused depressant. The body tends to develop tol-\\nerance for CNS depressants, and larger doses are needed\\nto achieve the same effects. Withdrawal from some CNS\\ndepressants can be uncomfortable; for example, with-\\ndrawal from a depressant treating insomnia or anxiety can\\ncause rebound insomnia or anxiety as the brain’s activity\\nbounces back after being suppressed. In some cases with-\\ndrawal can result in life-threatening seizures. Generally,\\ndepressant withdrawal should be undertaken under a\\nphysician’s supervision. Many physicians will reduce the\\ndepressant dosage gradually, to give the body time to\\nadjust. Certain CNS depressants such as barbiturates are\\neasy to overdose on, since there is a relatively small dif-\\nference between the optimal dose and an overdose. A\\nsmall miscalculation can lead to coma, slowed breathing,\\nand death. CNS depressants should be administered to\\nelderly individuals with care, as these individuals have a\\nreduced ability to metabolize CNS depressants.\\nSide Effects\\nEspecially when taken in excess, CNS depressants can\\ncause confusion and dizziness, and impair judgment, mem-\\nory, intellectual performance, and motor coordination.\\nInteractions\\nCNS depressants should be used with other medica-\\ntions, such as antidepressant medications, only under a\\nphysician’s supervision. Certain herbal remedies, such as\\nValerian and Kava, may dangerously exacerbate the\\neffects of certain CNS depressants.

Abscesses\\nhave fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack definable\\nshape and size. CNS infections are classified according\\nto the location where they occur. For example, a spinal\\nepidural abscess is located above the dura mater, and a\\ncranial subdural empyema occurs between the dura\\nmater and the arachnoid.\\nAs pus and other material from an infection accumu-\\nlate, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord. This\\npressure can damage the nervous system tissue, possibly\\npermanently. Without treatment, a CNS infection is fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTypically, bacterial invasion results from the spread\\nof a nearby infection; for example, a chronic sinus or\\nmiddle ear infection can extend beyond its initial site.\\nBacteria may also be conveyed to the CNS from distant\\nsites of infection by the bloodstream.

There is a potential for seizures,paral-\\nysis, or coma.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysical symptoms, such as a fever and intense\\nbackache or a fever, severe headache, and stiff neck, raise\\nthe suspicion of a CNS infection.

A lumbar puncture and analysis of the\\ncerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epidural\\nabscess; however, the procedure can be dangerous in\\ncases of subdural empyema.\\nTreatment\\nA two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS infec-\\ntions. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of potential\\ninfectious bacteria is begun. The second stage involves\\nsurgery to drain the infected site. Although some CNS\\ninfections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the\\nmore aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allows\\nimmediate relief of pressure on the brain or spinal cord, as\\nwell as an opportunity to collect infectious material for bac-\\nterial identification.

Addition-\\nally, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine\\nsulfate (Dexedrine) are used for their paradoxical effect\\nin attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\\nThe anerexiants, benzphetamine (Didrex), diethyl-\\npropion (Tenuate), phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine),\\nphentermine (Fastin, Ionamine), and sibutramine\\n(Meridia) are CNS stimulants used for appetite reduction\\nin severe obesity. Although these drugs are structurally\\nsimilar to amphetamine, they cause less sensation of\\nstimulation, and are less suited for use in conditions\\ncharacterized by lack of adrenergic stimulation.\\nPhenylpropanolamine and ephedrine have been used\\nboth as diet aids and as vasoconstrictors.\\nDescription\\nThe majority of CNS stimulants are chemically sim-\\nilar to the neurohormone norepinephrine, and simulate\\nthe traditional “fight or flight” syndrome associated with\\nsympathetic nervous system arousal. Caffeine is more\\nclosely related to the xanthines, such as theophylline. A\\nsmall number of additional members of the CNS stimu-\\nlant class do not fall into specific chemical groups.\\nPrecautions\\nAmphetamines have a high potential for abuse. They\\nshould be used in weight reduction programs only when\\nalternative therapies have been ineffective. Administra-\\ntion for prolonged periods may lead to drug dependence.\\nThese drugs are classified as schedule II under federal\\ndrug control regulations.\\nThe amphetamines and their cogeners are con-\\ntraindicated in advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic\\ncardiovascular disease, and moderate to severe hyper-\\ntension and hyperthyroidism. They should not be used\\nto treat patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to\\nthe sympathomimetic amines, or with glaucoma, a histo-\\nry of agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or during\\nthe 14 days following administration of monoamine oxi-\\ndase (MAO) inhibitors.\\nMethylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold.\\nBenzphetamine is category X during pregnancy .\\nDiethylpropion is category B.

Safety for use of anorexiants has\\nnot been evaluated.\\nAmphetamines are all category C during pregnancy.\\nBreastfeeding while receiving amphetamines is not rec-\\nommended because the infant may experience withdraw-\\nal symptoms.\\nThere have been reports that when used in children,\\nmethylphenidate and amphetamines may retard growth.\\nAlthough these reports have been questioned, it may be\\nsuggested that the drugs not be administered outside of\\nschool hours (because most children have behavior prob-\\nlems in school), in order to permit full stature to be\\nattained.\\nThe most common adverse effects of CNS stimulants\\nare associated with their primary action. Typical respons-\\nes include overstimulation,dizziness , restlessness, and\\nsimilar reactions. Rarely, hematologic reactions, includ-\\ning leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and bone marrow\\ndepression have been reported.

The fibrils tend to clump togeth-\\ner, so that the amyloid cannot be dissolved and builds up\\nin the brain blood vessel walls. One form of amyloid fibril\\nsubunit proteins is the amyloid beta protein.\\nDifferent theories have been suggested for the\\nsource of amyloid beta protein in the brain. The systemic\\ntheory suggests that amyloid beta protein in the blood\\nstream is deposited in blood vessels in the brain, causing\\nweakness in the blood vessel wall and breakdown in the\\nblood-brain barrier. Normally, the blood-brain barrier\\nkeeps proteins and other large molecules from escaping\\nfrom the blood vessel to the brain tissue. When there is\\nbreakdown of the blood-brain barrier, amyloid beta pro-\\ntein leaks through the blood vessel wall, and is deposited\\nin the brain substance, where it forms an abnormal struc-\\nture called a neuritic plaque.\\nA second, more likely theory is that amyloid fibrils\\nthat form amyloid beta protein are produced by perivas-\\ncular microglia, or support cells in contact with the brain\\nblood vessel wall. The third theory is that the brain tissue\\ngives rise to amyloid beta protein. Both the nerve cells\\nand the glia are known to produce amyloid precursor\\nprotein, which increases with aging and with cell stress.\\nBleeding into the brain may occur as tiny blood ves-\\nsels carrying amyloid deposits become heavier and more\\nbrittle, and are therefore more likely to burst with minor\\ntrauma or with fluctuating blood pressure. Aneurysms, or\\nballooning of the blood vessel wall, may develop, and\\nmay also rupture as the stretched wall becomes thinner\\nand is under more pressure. Amyloid deposits may\\ndestroy smooth muscle cells or cause inflammation in the\\nblood vessel wall. This may also cause the blood vessel\\nto break more easily.\\nThe most common form of CAA is the sporadic\\nform associated with aging. This type of CAA usually\\ncauses lobar hemorrhage, which may recur in different\\nlobes of the brain. The frontal lobe (behind the forehead)\\nand parietal lobe (behind the frontal lobe) are most often\\naffected; the temporal lobe (near the temple) and occipi-\\ntal lobe (at the back of the brain) are affected less often;\\nand the cerebellum (under the occipital lobe) is rarely\\naffected. Approximately 10–50% of hemorrhages in spo-\\nradic CAA involve more than one lobe.\\nSymptoms of lobar hemorrhage in CAA include\\nsudden onset of headache, neurologic symptoms such as\\nweakness, sensory loss, visual changes, or speech prob-\\nlems, depending on which lobe is involved; and\\ndecreased level of consciousness (a patient who is diffi-\\ncult to arouse), nausea, and vomiting.

Brain biopsy (surgical removal of a small\\npiece of brain tissue) may show characteristic amyloid\\ndeposits, but is rarely performed, as the risk may not be\\njustifiable in the absence of effective treatment for CAA.\\nIf diagnosis is uncertain, biopsy may be needed to rule\\nout conditions which are potentially treatable. Definite\\ndiagnosis requires microscopic examination of brain tis-\\nsue, either at biopsy, at autopsy, or at surgery when brain\\nhemorrhage is drained. Lumbar puncture to examine\\ncerebrospinal fluid proteins may show characteristic\\nabnormalities, but is not part of the routine exam. In\\nfamilial forms, genetic analysis may be helpful.\\nCAA with hemorrhage must be distinguished from\\nother types of brain hemorrhage. In CAA, hemorrhage\\ntypically occurs in the lobar region, often ruptures into the\\nsubarachnoid space between the brain and its coverings,\\nand occurs at night. In hemorrhage related to high blood\\npressure, hemorrhage is usually deeper within the brain,\\nruptures into the ventricles or cavities deep inside the\\nbrain, and occurs during daytime activities. Other causes\\nof brain hemorrhage are arteriovenous malformations ,\\ntrauma, aneurysms, bleeding into a brain tumor, vasculi-\\ntis (inflammation of blood vessels), or bleeding disorders.\\nTreatment\\nAlthough there is no effective treatment for the under-\\nlying disease process of CAA, measures can be taken to\\nprevent brain hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with CAA.\\nHigh blood pressure should be treated aggressively, and\\neven normal blood pressure can be lowered as much as tol-\\nerated without side effects from medications. Blood thin-\\nners such as Coumadin, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin,\\nor medications designed to dissolve blood clots may cause\\nhemorrhage in patients with CAA, and should be avoided if\\npossible. If these medications are required for other condi-\\ntions, such as heart disease, the potential benefits must be\\ncarefully weighed against the increased risks.\\nSeizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms thought\\nto be seizures, should be treated with anti-epileptic\\ndrugs, although Depakote (sodium valproate) should be\\navoided because of its antiplatelet effect.

Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges outward\\nand fills with blood. This bulge is called an aneurysm. An\\naneurysm can rupture, spilling blood into the surround-\\ning body tissue. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm can cause\\npermanent brain damage, disability, or death.\\nDescription\\nA cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the brain.\\nAneurysms can have several shapes. The saccular\\naneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles a piece\\nof fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular aneurysms are\\nusually found at a branch in the blood vessel where they\\nballoon out by a thin neck. Saccular cerebral aneurysms\\nmost often occur at the branch points of large arteries at the\\nbase of the brain. Aneurysms may also take the form of a\\nbulge in one wall of the artery—a lateral aneurysm—or a\\nwidening of the entire artery—a fusiform aneurysm.\\nThe greatest danger of aneurysms is rupture.\\nApproximately 50–75% of stricken people survive an\\naneurysmal rupture. A ruptured aneurysm spills blood\\ninto the brain or into the fluid-filled area that surrounds\\nthe brain tissue. Bleeding into this area, called the sub-\\narachnoid space, is referred to as subarachnoid hemor-\\nrhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH each\\nyear. It is estimated that people with unruptured\\naneurysm have an annual 1–2% risk of hemorrhage.\\nUnder age 40, more men experience SAH. After age 40,\\nmore women than men are affected.\\nMost people who have suffered a SAH from a rup-\\ntured aneurysm did not know that the aneurysm even\\nexisted. Based on autopsy studies, medical researchers\\nestimate that 1–5% of the population has some type of\\ncerebral aneurysm. Aneurysms rarely occur in the very\\nyoung or the very old; about 60% of aneurysms are diag-\\nnosed in people between ages 40 and 65.\\nSome aneurysms may have a genetic link and run in\\nfamilies. The genetic link has not been completely\\nproven and a pattern of inheritance has not been deter-\\nmined. Some studies seem to show that first-degree rela-\\ntives of people who suffered aneurysmal SAH are more\\nlikely to have aneurysms themselves. These studies\\nreported that such immediate family members were four\\ntimes more likely to have aneurysms than the general\\npopulation. Other studies do not confirm these findings.\\nBetter evidence links aneurysms to certain rare diseases\\nof the connective tissue. These diseases include Marfan\\nsyndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Ehlers-Danlos\\nsyndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Polycystic kid-\\nney disease is also associated with cerebral aneurysms.\\nThese diseases are also associated with an increased\\nrisk of aneurysmal rupture.

CP is caused by events\\nbefore, during, or after birth. The abnormalities of mus-\\ncle control that define CP are often accompanied by\\nother neurological and physical abnormalities.\\nDescription\\nV oluntary movement (walking, grasping, chewing,\\netc.) is primarily accomplished using muscles that are\\nattached to bones, known as the skeletal muscles. Control\\nof the skeletal muscles originates in the cerebral cortex,\\nthe largest portion of the brain. Palsy means paralysis ,\\nbut may also be used to describe uncontrolled muscle\\nmovement. Therefore, cerebral palsy encompasses any\\ndisorder of abnormal movement and paralysis caused by\\nabnormal function of the cerebral cortex. In truth, howev-\\ner, CP does not include conditions due to progressive dis-\\nease or degeneration of the brain. For this reason, CP is\\nalso referred to as static (nonprogressive) encephalopathy\\n(disease of the brain). Also excluded from CP are any dis-\\norders of muscle control that arise in the muscles them-\\nselves and/or in the peripheral nervous system (nerves\\noutside the brain and spinal cord).\\nCP is not a specific diagnosis, but is more accurately\\nconsidered a description—a description of a broad but\\ndefined group of neurological and physical problems.\\nThe symptoms of CP and their severity are quite\\nvariable. Those with CP may have only minor difficulty\\nwith fine motor skills, such as grasping and manipulating\\nitems with their hands. A severe form of CP could\\ninvolve significant muscle problems in all four limbs,\\nmental retardation, seizures, and difficulties with\\nvision, speech, and hearing.\\nMuscles that receive defective messages from the\\nbrain may be constantly contracted and tight (spastic),\\nexhibit involuntary writhing movements (athetosis), or\\nhave difficulty with voluntary movement (dyskinesia).\\nThere can also be a lack of balance and coordination with\\nunsteady movements (ataxia). A combination of any of\\nthese problems may also occur. Spastic CP and mixed\\nCP constitute the majority of cases. Effects on the mus-\\ncles can range from mild weakness or partial paralysis\\n(paresis), to complete loss of voluntary control of a mus-\\ncle or group of muscles (plegia). CP is also designated by\\nthe number of limbs affected. For instance, affected mus-\\ncles in one limb is monoplegia, both arms or both legs is\\ndiplegia, both limbs on one side of the body is hemiple-\\ngia, and in all four limbs is quadriplegia. Muscles of the\\ntrunk, neck, and head may be affected as well.\\nCP can be caused by a number of different mecha-\\nnisms at various times—from several weeks after concep-\\ntion, through birth, to early childhood. For many years, it\\nwas accepted that most cases of CP were due to brain\\ninjuries received during a traumatic birth, known as birth\\nasphyxia. However, extensive research in the 1980s\\nshowed that only 5–10% of CP can be attributed to birth\\ntrauma. Other possible causes include abnormal develop-\\nment of the brain, prenatal factors that directly or indirectly\\ndamage neurons in the developing brain, premature birth,\\nand brain injuries that occur in the first few years of life.\\nAdvances in the medical care of premature infants in\\nthe last 20 years have dramatically increased the rate of\\nsurvival of these fragile newborns. However, as gesta-\\ntional age at delivery and birth weight of a baby\\ndecrease, the risk for CP dramatically increases. A term\\npregnancyis delivered at 37–41 weeks gestation. The\\nrisk for CP in a preterm infant (32–37 weeks) is\\nincreased about five-fold over the risk for an infant born\\nat term. Survivors of extremely preterm births (less than\\n28 weeks) face as much as a 50-fold increase in risk.\\nAbout 50% of all cases of CP now being diagnosed are in\\nchildren who were born prematurely.\\nTwo factors are involved in the risk for CP associat-\\ned with prematurity. First, premature babies are at high-\\ner risk for various CP-associated medical complications,\\nsuch as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, and difficul-\\nty in breathing, to name a few. Second, the onset of pre-\\nmature labor may be induced, in part, by complications\\nthat have already caused neurologic damage in the fetus.\\nA combination of both factors almost certainly plays a\\nrole in some cases of CP. The tendency toward premature\\ndelivery runs in families, but the genetic mechanisms are\\nfar from clear.\\nAn increase in multiple pregnancies in recent years,\\nespecially in the United States, is blamed on the\\nincreased use of fertility drugs. As the number of fetuses\\nin a pregnancy increases, the risks for abnormal develop-\\nment and premature delivery also increase. Children\\nfrom twin pregnancies have four times the risk of devel-\\noping CP as children from singleton pregnancies, owing\\nto the fact that more twin pregnancies are delivered pre-\\nmaturely. The risk for CP in a child of triplets is up to 18\\ntimes greater.

Ironically, advances in medicine have decreased\\nthe incidence from some causes, Rh disease for example,\\nbut increased it from others, notably, prematurity and\\nmultiple pregnancies. No particular ethnic groups seem\\nto be at higher risk for CP. However, people of disadvan-\\ntaged background are at higher risk due to poorer access\\nto proper prenatal care and advanced medical services.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs noted, CP has many causes, making a discussion\\nof the genetics of CP complicated. A number of heredi-\\ntary/genetic syndromes have signs and symptoms similar\\nto CP, but usually also have problems not typical of CP.\\nPut another way, some hereditary conditions “mimic”\\nCP. Isolated CP, meaning CP that is not a part of some\\nother syndrome or disorder, is usually not inherited.\\nIt might be possible to group the causes of CP into\\nthose that are genetic and those that are non-genetic, but\\nmost would fall somewhere in between. Grouping causes\\ninto those that occur during pregnancy (prenatal), those\\nthat happen around the time of birth (perinatal), and those\\nthat occur after birth (postnatal), is preferable. CP related\\nto premature birth and multiple pregnancies (twins,\\ntriplets, etc., not “many pregnancies”) is somewhat differ-\\nent and considered separately.\\nPrenatal causes\\nAlthough much has been learned about human\\nembryology in the last couple of decades, a great deal\\nremains unknown. Studying prenatal human develop-\\nment is difficult because the embryo and fetus develop in\\na closed environment—the mother’s womb. However,\\nthe relatively recent development of a number of prenatal\\ntests has opened a window on the process. Add to that\\nmore accurate and complete evaluations of newborns,\\nespecially those with problems, and a clearer picture of\\nwhat can go wrong before birth is possible.\\nThe complicated process of brain development before\\nbirth is susceptible to many chance errors that can result in\\nabnormalities of varying degrees. Some of these errors\\nwill result in structural anomalies of the brain, while oth-\\ners may cause undetectable, but significant, abnormalities\\nin how the cerebral cortex is “wired.” An abnormality in\\nstructure or wiring is sometimes hereditary, but is most\\noften due to chance, or a cause unknown at this time.\\nWhether and how much genetics played a role in a particu-\\nlar brain abnormality depends to some degree on the type\\nof anomaly and the form of CP it causes.\\nSeveral maternal-fetal infections are known to\\nincrease the risk for CP, including rubella (German\\nmeasles, now rare in the United States), cytomegalovirus\\n(CMV), and toxoplasmosis . Each of these infections is\\nconsidered a risk to the fetus only if the mother contracts\\nit for the first time during that pregnancy. Even in those\\ncases, though, most babies will be born normal. Most\\nwomen are immune to all three infections by the time\\nthey reach childbearing age, but a woman’s immune sta-\\ntus can be determined using the so-called TORCH (for\\nToxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes)\\ntest before or during pregnancy.\\nJust as a stroke can cause neurologic damage in an\\nadult, so too can this type of event occur in the fetus. A\\nburst blood vessel in the brain followed by uncontrolled\\nbleeding (coagulopathy), known as intracerebral hemor-\\nrhage, could cause a fetal stroke, or a cerebral blood ves-\\nsel could be obstructed by a clot (embolism). Infants who\\nlater develop CP, along with their mothers, are more like-\\nly than other mother-infant pairs to test positive for fac-\\ntors that put them at increased risk for bleeding episodes\\nor blood clots. Some coagulation disorders are strictly\\nhereditary, but most have a more complicated basis.\\nA teratogen is any substance to which a woman is\\nexposed that has the potential to harm the embryo or\\nfetus. Links between a drug or other chemical exposure\\nduring pregnancy and a risk for CP are difficult to prove.\\nHowever, any substance that might affect fetal brain\\ndevelopment, directly or indirectly, could increase the\\nrisk for CP. Furthermore, any substance that increases the\\nrisk for premature delivery and low birth weight, such as\\nalcohol, tobacco, or cocaine, among others, might indi-\\nrectly increase the risk for CP.\\nThe fetus receives all nutrients and oxygen from\\nblood that circulates through the placenta. Therefore,\\nanything that interferes with normal placental function\\nmight adversely affect development of the fetus, includ-\\ning the brain, or might increase the risk for premature\\ndelivery. Structural abnormalities of the placenta, prema-\\nture detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall\\n(abruption), and placental infections (chorioamnionitis)\\nare thought to pose some risk for CP.\\nCertain conditions in the mother during pregnancy\\nmight pose a risk to fetal development leading to CP.\\nWomen with autoimmune anti-thyroid or anti-phospho-\\nlipid (APA) antibodies are at slightly increased risk for\\nCP in their children. A potentially important clue uncov-\\nered recently points toward high levels of cytokines in\\nthe maternal and fetal circulation as a possible risk for\\nCP.

Likewise, inges-\\ntion of a toxic substance such as lead, mercury, poisons,\\nor certain chemicals could cause neurological damage.\\nAccidental overdose of certain medications might also\\ncause similar damage to the central nervous system.\\nBy definition, the defect in cerebral function causing\\nCP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms of CP\\noften change over time. Most of the symptoms of CP\\nrelate in some way to the aberrant control of muscles. To\\nreview, CP is categorized first by the type of move-\\nment/postural disturbance(s) present, then by a descrip-\\ntion of which limbs are affected, and finally by the sever-\\nity of motor impairment. For example, spastic diplegia\\nrefers to continuously tight muscles that have no volun-\\ntary control in both legs, while athetoid quadraparesis\\ndescribes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscle\\nweakness in all four limbs. These three-part descriptions\\nare helpful in providing a general picture, but cannot give\\na complete description of any one person with CP. In\\naddition, the various “forms” of CP do not occur with\\nequal frequency—spastic diplegia is seen in more indi-\\nviduals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also be\\nloosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, but\\nthese are very subjective terms with no firm boundaries\\nbetween them.\\nA muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic,\\nwhile excessively loose muscles are hypotonic. Spastic,\\nhypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic prob-\\nlems, including scoliosis (spine curvature), hip disloca-\\ntion, or contractures . A contracture is shortening of a\\nmuscle, aided sometimes by a weak-opposing force from\\na neighboring muscle. Contractures may become perma-\\nnent, or “fixed,” without some sort of intervention. Fixed\\ncontractures may cause postural abnormalities in the\\naffected limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equi-\\nnus or equinovarus) are common in people with CP.\\nSpasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and cross\\nat the knees, resulting in an unusual method of walking\\nknown as a “scissors gait.” Any of the joints in the limbs\\nmay be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of the\\nattached muscles.\\nAthetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity,\\nbut do not often occur alone. The same is true of ataxia.\\nIt is important to remember that “mild CP” or “severe\\nCP” refers not only to the number of symptoms present,\\nbut also to the level of involvement of any particular\\nclass of symptoms.\\nMechanisms that can cause CP are not always\\nrestricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other neu-\\nrologically based symptoms may include:\\n• mental retardation/learning disabilities\\n• behavioral disorders\\n• seizure disorders\\n• visual impairment\\n• hearing loss\\n• speech impairment (dysarthria)\\n• abnormal sensation and perception\\nThese problems may have a greater impact on a\\nchild’s life than the physical impairments of CP, although\\nnot all children with CP are affected by other problems.\\nMany infants and children with CP have growth impair-\\nment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moder-\\nate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild men-\\ntal retardation, and one-third have normal intelligence.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth.\\nChildren normally progress through a predictable set of\\ndevelopmental milestones through the first 18 months of\\nlife. Children with CP, however, tend to develop these\\nskills more slowly because of their motor impairments,\\nand delays in reaching milestones are usually the first\\nsymptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CP\\nare usually diagnosed earlier than others.\\nSelected developmental milestones, and the ages for\\nnormally acquiring them, are given below. If a child does\\nnot acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses,\\nthere is some cause for concern.\\n• sits well unsupported—six months (eight–10 months)\\n• babbles—six months (eight months)\\n• crawls—nine months (12 months)\\n• finger feeds, holds bottle—nine months (12 months)\\n• walks alone—12 months (15–18 months)\\n• uses one or two words other than dada/mama—12\\nmonths (15 months)\\n• walks up and down steps—24 months (24–36 months)\\n• turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks—24\\nmonths (30 months)\\nChildren do not consistently favor one hand over the\\nother before 12–18 months, and doing so may be a sign\\nthat the child has difficulty using the other hand. This\\nsame preference for one side of the body may show up as\\nasymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg while\\nclimbing stairs.\\nIt must be remembered that children normally\\nprogress at somewhat different rates, and slow beginning\\naccomplishment is often followed by normal develop-\\nment.

CP is nonprogressive, so con-\\ntinued loss of previously acquired milestones indicates\\nthat CP is not the cause of the problem.\\nNo one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors\\nincrease suspicion. The Apgar score measures a baby’s\\ncondition immediately after birth. Babies that have low\\nApgar scores are at increased risk for CP. Presence of\\nabnormal muscle tone or movements may indicate CP, as\\nmay the persistence of infantile reflexes. Imaging of the\\nbrain using ultrasound, x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans may\\nreveal a structural anomaly. Some brain lesions associated\\nwith CP include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebral\\nventricles (hydrocephalus), periventricular leukomalacia\\n(an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles),\\nareas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of an intra-\\ncerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and urine bio-\\nchemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be used to rule\\nout other possible causes, including muscle and peripheral\\nnerve diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, and\\nother inherited disorders. Evaluations by a pediatric devel-\\nopmental specialist and a geneticist may be of benefit.\\nTreatment\\nCerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the dis-\\nabilities it causes can be managed through planning and\\ntimely care. Treatment for a child with CP depends on the\\nseverity, nature, and location of the primary muscular symp-\\ntoms, as well as any associated problems that might be pre-\\nsent. Optimal care of a child with mild CP may involve reg-\\nular interaction with only a physical therapist and occupa-\\ntional therapist, whereas care for a more severely affected\\nchild may include visits to multiple medical specialists\\nthroughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan,\\nmost people with CP can lead productive, happy lives.\\nTherapy\\nSpasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,\\nand scoliosis are all significant impairments that affect the\\nposture and mobility of a person with CP. Physical and\\noccupational therapists work with the patient, and the fam-\\nily, to maximize the ability to move affected limbs, devel-\\nop normal motor patterns, and maintain posture. “Assistive\\ntechnology,” things such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoe\\ninserts, crutches, and braces, are often required. A speech\\ntherapist, and high-tech aids such as computer-controlled\\ncommunication devices, can make a tremendous differ-\\nence in the life of those who have speech impairments.\\nMedications\\nBefore fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant\\ndrugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantri-\\num), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botu-\\nlinum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly effective treat-\\nment, is injected directly into the affected muscles. Alco-\\nhol or phenol injections into the nerve controlling the\\nmuscle are another option. Multiple medications are\\navailable to control seizures, and athetosis can be treated\\nusing medications such as trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane)\\nand benztropine (Cogentin).\\nSurgery\\nFixed contractures are usually treated with either\\nserial casting or surgery. The most commonly used surgi-\\ncal procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer, and dorsal\\nrhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the affected muscle\\nare cut and the limb is cast in a more normal position\\nwhile the tendon regrows. Alternatively, tendon transfer\\ninvolves cutting and reattaching a tendon at a different\\npoint on the bone to enhance the length and function of\\nthe muscle. A neurosurgeon performing dorsal rhizotomy\\ncarefully cuts selected nerve roots in the spinal cord to\\nprevent them from stimulating the spastic muscles. Neu-\\nrosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tiny\\nelectrodes directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a por-\\ntion of the hypothalamus, have very specific uses and\\nhave had mixed results.\\nEducation\\nParents of a child newly diagnosed with CP are not\\nlikely to have the necessary expertise to coordinate the\\nfull range of care their child will need. Although\\nknowledgeable and caring medical professionals are\\nindispensable for developing a care plan, a potentially\\nmore important source of information and advice is\\nother parents who have dealt with the same set of diffi-\\nculties. Support groups for parents of children with CP\\ncan be significant sources of both practical advice and\\nemotional support. Many cities have support groups\\nthat can be located through the United Cerebral Palsy\\nAssociation, and most large medical centers have spe-\\ncial multidisciplinary clinics for children with develop-\\nmental disorders.\\nPrognosis\\nCerebral palsy can affect every stage of maturation,\\nfrom childhood through adolescence to adulthood.

For example, in people who have blood clotting\\n(coagulation) or bleeding disorders, lumbar puncture\\ncan cause bleeding that can compress the spinal cord. If\\nthere is a large brain tumor or other mass, removal of\\nCSF can cause the brain to droop down within the skull\\ncavity (herniate), compressing the brain stem and other\\nvital structures, and leading to irreversible brain damage\\nor death.

It affects between 2–6% of the general popula-\\ntion in the United States. Impaction does not happen\\nunder normal circumstances because cerumen is pro-\\nduced by glands in the outer part of the ear canal; it is not\\nproduced in the inner part. The cerumen traps sand or\\ndust particles before they reach the ear drum. It also pro-\\ntects the outer part of the ear canal because it repels\\nwater. The slow movement of the outer layer of skin of\\nthe ear canal carries cerumen toward the outer opening of\\nthe ear. As the older cerumen reaches the opening of the\\near, it dries out and falls away.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nCerumen is most likely to become impacted when it\\nis pushed against the eardrum by cotton-tipped applica-\\ntors, hair pins, or other objects that people put in their\\nears; and when it is trapped against the eardrum by a\\nhearing aid. Less common causes of cerumen impaction\\ninclude overproduction of earwax by the glands in the\\near canal, or an abnormally shaped ear canal.\\nSymptoms\\nThe most important symptom of cerumen impaction\\nis partial loss of hearing. Other symptoms are itching ,\\ntinnitus (noise or ringing in the ears), a sensation of full-\\nness in the ear, and pain.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 709\\nCerumen impaction'),\n",

It involves washing out the ear canal\\nwith water from a commercial irrigator or a syringe with\\na catheter attached. Although some doctors use Water\\nPiks to remove cerumen, most do not recommend them\\nbecause the stream of water is too forceful and may dam-\\nage the eardrum. The doctor may add a small amount of\\nalcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other antiseptic. The\\nwater must be close to body temperature; if it is too cold\\nor too warm, the patient may feel dizzy or nauseated.\\nAfter the ear has been irrigated, the doctor will apply\\nantibiotic ear drops to protect the ear from infection.\\nIrrigation should not be used to remove cerumen if\\nthe patient’s eardrum is ruptured or missing; if the patient\\nhas a history of chronic otitis media (inflammation of\\nthe middle ear) or a myringotomy (cutting the eardrum to\\nallow fluid to escape from the middle ear); or if the\\npatient has hearing in only one ear.\\nIf irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the\\ncerumen, the patient is referred to an ear, nose, and throat\\n(ENT) specialist. The specialist can remove the wax with\\na vacuum device or a curette, which is a small scoop-\\nshaped surgical instrument.\\nSome doctors prescribe special ear drops, such as\\nCerumenex, to soften the wax. The most common side\\neffect of Cerumenex is an allergic skin reaction. Over-\\nthe-counter wax removal products include Debrox or\\nMurine Ear Drops. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide\\nmay also be used. These products are less likely to irri-\\ntate the skin of the ear.\\nPrognosis\\nIn most cases, impacted cerumen is successfully\\nremoved by irrigation with no lasting side effects. Irriga-\\ntion can, however, lead to infection of the outer or the\\nmiddle ear if the patient has a damaged or absent ear\\ndrum. Patients who try to remove earwax themselves\\nwith hair pins or similar objects run the risk of perforat-\\ning the ear drum or damaging the fragile skin covering\\nthe ear canal, causing bleeding and the risk of infection.\\nPrevention\\nThe best method of cleaning the external ear is to\\nwipe the outer opening with a damp washcloth folded over\\nthe index finger, without going into the ear canal itself.\\nTwo techniques have been recommended to prevent ceru-\\nmen from reaccumulating in the ear.

Frey, PhD\\nCervical biopsy see Cervical conization\\nCervical cancer\\nDefinition\\nCervical cancer is a disease in which the cells of the\\ncervix become abnormal and start to grow uncontrol-\\nlably, forming tumors.\\nDescription\\nIn the United States, cervical cancer is the fifth most\\ncommon cancer among women aged 35–54, and the third\\nmost common cancer of the female reproductive tract. In\\nsome developing countries, it is the most common type\\nof cancer. It generally begins as an abnormality in the\\ncells on the outside of the cervix. The cervix is the lower\\npart or neck of the uterus (womb). It connects the body\\nof the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).\\nApproximately 90% of cervical cancers are squamous\\ncell carcinomas. This type of cancer originates in the thin,\\nflat, squamous cells on the surface of the ectocervix, the\\npart of the cervix that is next to the vagina. (Squamous\\ncells are the thin, flat cells of the surfaces of the skin and\\ncervix and linings of various organs.) Another 10% of cer-\\nvical cancers are of the adenocarcinoma type. This cancer\\noriginates in the mucus-producing cells of the inner or\\nendocervix, near the body of the uterus. Occasionally, the\\ncancer may have characteristics of both types and is called\\nadenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma.\\nThe initial changes that may occur in some cervical\\ncells are not cancerous. However, these precancerous\\ncells form a lesion called dysplasia or a squamous\\nintraepithelial lesion (SIL), since it occurs within the\\nepithelial or outer layer of cells. These abnormal cells\\ncan also be described as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\\n(CIN). Moderate to severe dysplasia may be called carci-\\nnoma in situ or non-invasive cervical cancer.\\nDysplasia is a common condition and the abnormal\\ncells often disappear without treatment. However, these\\nprecancerous cells can become cancerous. This may take\\nyears, although it can happen in less than a year. Eventu-\\nally, the abnormal cells start to grow uncontrollably into\\nthe deeper layers of the cervix, becoming an invasive cer-\\nvical cancer.\\nAlthough cervical cancer used to be one of the most\\ncommon causes of cancer death among American\\nwomen, in the past 40 years there has been a 75% decrease\\nin mortality. This is primarily due to routine screening\\nwith Pap tests (Pap smear), to identify precancerous and\\nearly-invasive stages of cervical cancer. With treatment,\\nthese conditions have a cure rate of nearly 100%.\\nWorldwide, there are more than 400,000 new cases\\nof cervical cancer diagnosed each year. The American\\nCancer Society (ACS) estimates that there will be 12,900\\nnew cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in the\\nUnited States in 2001. More than one million women\\nwill be diagnosed with a precancerous lesion or non-\\ninvasive cancer of the cervix.\\nOlder women are at the highest risk for cervical can-\\ncer.

In the United States, the incidence of invasive\\ncervical cancer increases rapidly with age for African\\nAmerican women over the age of 25. The incidence rises\\nmore slowly for Caucasian women. However, women\\nover age 65 account for more than 25% of all cases of\\ninvasive cervical cancer.\\nThe incidence of cervical cancer is highest among\\npoor women and among women in developing countries.\\nIn the United States, the death rates from cervical cancer\\nare higher among Hispanic, Native American, and\\nAfrican American women than among Caucasian\\nwomen. These groups of women are much less likely to\\nreceive regular Pap tests. Therefore, their cervical can-\\ncers usually are diagnosed at a much later stage, after the\\ncancer has spread to other parts of the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHuman papilloma virus\\nInfection with the common human papilloma virus\\n(HPV) is a cause of approximately 90% of all cervical\\ncancers. There are more than 80 types of HPV . About 30\\nof these types can be transmitted sexually, including\\nthose that cause genital warts (papillomas). About half\\nof the sexually transmitted HPVs are associated with cer-\\nvical cancer. These “high-risk” HPVs produce a protein\\nthat can cause cervical epithelial cells to grow uncontrol-\\nlably. The virus makes a second protein that interferes\\nwith tumor suppressors that are produced by the human\\nimmune system. The HPV-16 strain is thought to be a\\ncause of about 50% of cervical cancers.\\nMore than six million women in the United States\\nhave persistent HPV infections, for which there is no\\ncure. Nevertheless, most women with HPV do not devel-\\nop cervical cancer.\\nSymptoms of invasive cervical cancer\\nMost women do not have symptoms of cervical can-\\ncer until it has become invasive. At that point, the symp-\\ntoms may include:\\n• unusual vaginal discharge\\n• light vaginal bleeding or spots of blood outside of nor-\\nmal menstruation\\n• pain or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse\\n• post-menopausal vaginal bleeding\\nOnce the cancer has invaded the tissue surrounding\\nthe cervix, a woman may experience pain in the pelvic\\nregion and heavy bleeding from the vagina.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Pap test\\nMost often, cervical cancer is first detected with a\\nPap test that is performed as part of a regular pelvic\\nexamination. The vagina is spread with a metal or plastic\\ninstrument called a speculum. A swab is used to remove\\nmucus and cells from the cervix. This sample is sent to a\\nlaboratory for microscopic examination.\\nThe Pap test is a screening tool rather than a diag-\\nnostic tool. It is very efficient at detecting cervical\\nabnormalities. The Bethesda System commonly is used\\nto report Pap test results. A negative test means that no\\nabnormalities are present in the cervical tissue. A posi-\\ntive Pap test describes abnormal cervical cells as low-\\ngrade or high-grade SIL, depending on the extent of\\ndysplasia. About 5–10% of Pap tests show at least mild\\nabnormalities. However, a number of factors other than\\ncervical cancer can cause abnormalities, including\\ninflammation from bacteria or yeast infections. A few\\nmonths after the infection is treated, the Pap test is\\nrepeated.\\nBiopsy\\nFollowing an abnormal Pap test, a colposcopy is\\nusually performed. The physician uses a magnifying\\nscope to view the surface of the cervix. The cervix may\\nbe coated with an iodine solution that causes normal cells\\nto turn brown and abnormal cells to turn white or yellow.\\nThis is called a Schiller test. If any abnormal areas are\\nobserved, a colposcopic biopsy may be performed. A\\nbiopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for micro-\\nscopic examination by a pathologist.\\nOther types of cervical biopsies may be performed.\\nAn endocervical curettage is a biopsy in which a narrow\\ninstrument called a curette is used to scrape tissue from\\ninside the opening of the cervix. A cone biopsy, or\\nconization, is used to remove a cone-shaped piece of tis-\\nsue from the cervix. In a cold knife cone biopsy, a surgi-\\ncal scalpel or laser is used to remove the tissue. A loop\\nelectrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a cone\\nbiopsy using a wire that is heated by an electrical cur-\\nrent. Cone biopsies can be used to determine whether\\nabnormal cells have invaded below the surface of the\\ncervix. They also can be used to treat many precancers\\nand very early cancers.

For example, additional\\npelvic exams may be performed under anesthesia.\\nThere are several procedures for determining if cer-\\nvical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With cys-\\ntoscopy, a lighted tube with a lens is inserted through the\\nurethra (the urine tube from the bladder to the exterior)\\nand into the bladder to examine these organs for cancer-\\nous cells. Tissue samples may be removed for micro-\\nscopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urog-\\nraphy (intravenous pyelogram or IVP) is an x ray of the\\nurinary system, following the injection of special dye.\\nThe kidneys remove the dye from the bloodstream and\\nthe dye passes into the ureters (the tubes from the kid-\\nneys to the bladder) and bladder. IVP can detect a\\nblocked ureter, caused by the spread of cancer to the\\npelvic lymph nodes (small glands that are part of the\\nimmune system).\\nA procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is\\nsimilar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine whether the\\ncancer has spread to the rectum or lower large intestine.\\nComputed tomography (CT or CAT) scans, ultra-\\nsound, or other imaging techniques may be used to deter-\\nmine the spread of cancer to various parts of the body.\\nWith a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body,\\ntaking images from various angles. It is used to deter-\\nmine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic\\nfield to image the body, sometimes is used for evaluating\\nthe spread of cervical cancer. Chest x rays may be used\\nto detect cervical cancer that has spread to the lungs.\\nTreatment\\nFollowing a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physi-\\ncian takes a medical history and performs a complete\\nphysical examination. This includes an evaluation of\\nsymptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The lymph\\nnodes are examined for evidence that the cancer has\\nspread from the cervix. The choice of treatment depends\\non the clinical stage of the disease.\\nThe FIGO system of staging\\nThe International Federation of Gynecologists and\\nObstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to stage cer-\\nvical cancer:\\n• Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that is\\nconfined to the layer of cells lining the cervix\\n• Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective tis-\\nsue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus\\n• Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible only\\nwith a microscope\\n• Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in)\\ndeep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide\\n• Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3–5 mm (0.13–0.2 in) deep\\nand less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide\\n• Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope or is\\ndeeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm (0.33 in)\\n• Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)\\n• Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)\\n• Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is con-\\nfined to the pelvic region\\n• Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of the\\nvagina, but not to the lower one-third of the vagina\\n• Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue\\nadjacent to the cervix\\n• Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of\\nthe vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may be\\nblocking the ureters\\n• Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina but\\nnot to the pelvic wall\\n• Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or\\nis blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to the\\nbladder\\n• Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body\\n• Stage IV A: Cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum\\n• Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such as\\nthe lungs\\n• Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to\\nthe cervix or some other part of the body\\nIn addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such as\\na woman’s age, general health, and preferences may\\ninfluence the choice of treatment.

The uterus\\nmay be removed either through the abdomen or the\\nvagina.\\nIn a radical hysterectomy, the uterus and adjoining\\ntissues, including the ovaries, the upper region (1 in) of\\nthe vagina near the cervix, and the pelvic lymph nodes,\\nare all removed. A radical hysterectomy usually involves\\nabdominal surgery. However, it can be performed vagi-\\nnally, in combination with a laparoscopic pelvic lymph\\nnode dissection. With laparoscopy , a tube is inserted\\nthrough a very small surgical incision for the removal of\\nthe lymph nodes. These operations are used to treat\\nstages IA2, IB, and IIA cervical cancers, particularly in\\nyoung women. Following a hysterectomy, the tissue is\\nexamined to see if the cancer has spread and requires\\nadditional radiation treatment. Women who have had\\nhysterectomies cannot become pregnant, but complica-\\ntions from a hysterectomy are rare.\\nIf cervical cancer recurs following treatment, a\\npelvic exenteration (extensive surgery) may be per-\\nformed. This includes a radical hysterectomy, with the\\nadditional removal of the bladder, rectum, part of the\\ncolon, and/or all of the vagina. Such operations require\\nthe creation of new openings for the urine and feces. A\\nnew vagina may be created surgically. Often the clitoris\\nand other outer genitals are left intact.\\nRecovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six\\nmonths to two years. This treatment is successful with\\n40–50% of recurrent cervical cancers that are confined to\\nthe pelvis. If the recurrent cancer has spread to other\\norgans, radiation or chemotherapy may be used to alle-\\nviate some of the symptoms.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation therapy, which involves the use of high-\\ndosage x rays or other high-energy waves to kill cancer\\ncells, often is used for treating stages IB, IIA, and IIB\\ncervical cancers, or in combination with surgery. With\\nexternal-beam radiation therapy, the rays are focused on\\nthe pelvic area from a source outside the body. With\\nimplant or internal radiation therapy, a pellet of radioac-\\ntive material is placed internally, near the tumor. Alterna-\\ntively, thin needles may be used to insert the radioactive\\nmaterial directly into the tumor.\\nRadiation therapy to the pelvic region can have\\nmany side effects:\\n• skin reaction in the area of treatment\\n• fatigue\\n• upset stomach and loose bowels\\n• vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina due to build-\\nup of scar tissue) leading to painful sexual intercourse\\n• premature menopause in young women\\n• problems with urination\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy, the use of one or more drugs to kill\\ncancer cells, is used to treat disease that has spread\\nbeyond the cervix. Most often it is used following\\nsurgery or radiation treatment. Stages IIB, III, IV , and\\nrecurrent cervical cancers usually are treated with a\\ncombination of external and internal radiation and\\nchemotherapy. The common drugs used for cervical\\ncancer are cisplatin, ifosfamide, and fluorouracil. These\\nmay be injected or taken by mouth. The National Cancer\\nInstitute recommends that chemotherapy with cisplatin\\nbe considered for all women receiving radiation therapy\\nfor cervical cancer.\\nThe side effects of chemotherapy depend on a num-\\nber of factors, including the type of drug, the dosage, and\\nthe length of the treatment. Side effects may include:\\n• nausea and vomiting\\n• fatigue\\n• changes in appetite\\n• hair loss\\n• mouth or vaginal sores\\n• infections\\n• menstrual cycle changes\\n• premature menopause\\n•infertility\\n• bleeding or anemia (low red blood cell count)\\nWith the exception of menopause and infertility,\\nmost of the side effects are temporary.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBiological therapy sometimes is used to treat cervi-\\ncal cancer, either alone or in combination with\\nchemotherapy.

The cervix is the small cylindrical organ at the\\nlower part of the uterus, which separates the uterus from\\nthe vagina. Cervical conization also may be performed if\\nthere is an abnormal cervical smear test (PAP test).

Alternatively, the wound may be left\\nopen, and heat or freezing is used to stop bleeding.\\nOnce the tissue has been removed, it is examined\\nunder a microscope for signs of cancer. If cancer is pre-\\nsent, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be per-\\nformed to remove the cervix and uterus (hysterectomy)\\nand other treatments may be used as well.

Turkington\\nCervical disk disease\\nDefinition\\nCervical disk disease refers to a gradual deteriora-\\ntion of the spongy disks in the top part of the spine.\\nDescription\\nThe spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae\\nseparated by spongy rings of elastic material. These\\nrings, known as disks, are often compared to shock\\nabsorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.\\nJust as importantly, they also make it possible to turn the\\nhead and neck. Over time, these disks slowly become\\nflattened and less elastic due to everyday wear and tear.\\nWhen this process occurs in the disks of the neck, it is\\nreferred to as cervical disk disease. Other general terms\\nfor this process include degenerative disk disease and\\nintervertebral disk disease.\\nCervical disk disease affects everyone to some\\ndegree, often without causing any bothersome symp-\\ntoms. However, this condition can also lead to specific\\nproblems related to nerve functioning. For example, the\\nouter edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinous\\nmaterial inside to bulge outward (herniated disk ). This\\ncan put pressure on nerves that exit the spine. Two adja-\\ncent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes resulting in\\nbone spurs) that can also pinch these nerves. In other\\ncases, the inner part of the ring may push on the spinal\\ncord itself, which passes through the disk. Any of these\\nsituations can cause pain and limit movement. While\\nsymptoms primarily affect the neck, they can also occur\\nin other parts of the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCervical disk disease is a gradual process that occurs\\nwith aging, though poor posture, repeated lifting, and\\ntobacco use can hasten its course. Symptoms include\\npain when moving the neck and limited neck movement.\\nThe condition can also affect the hand, shoulder, and arm\\nresulting in pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness. If\\nthe spinal cord itself is affected, these symptoms may\\noccur in the legs. Loss of bowel or bladder control may\\nalso occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nCervical disk disease is typically diagnosed by an\\northopedist or a neurologist. After taking a medical his-\\ntory and conducting a physical examination, the doctor\\nwill recommend an imaging procedure to gather more\\ninformation about the nature of the problem. This may\\ninclude a CT scan, an MRI, or myelography . In addi-\\ntion, an electromyogram (EMG) may be used to evalu-\\nate the functioning of nerves in the arms, hands, or legs.\\nCervical disk disease is typically covered by medical\\ninsurance.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment usually involves physical therapy, several\\nweeks of drug therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs (NSAIDs), and limited use of a cervical\\ncollar (to reduce neck movement).

These changes can alter\\nthe alignment and stability of the spine. They may go\\nunnoticed, or they may produce problems related to pres-\\nsure on the spine and associated nerves and blood ves-\\nsels. This pressure can cause weakness, numbness, and\\npainin various areas of the body. In severe cases, walk-\\ning and other activities may be compromised.\\nDescription\\nAs it runs from the brain down the back, the spinal\\ncord is protected by ringlike bones, called vertebrae,\\nstacked one upon the other. The vertebrae are not in\\ndirect contact with one another, however. The interven-\\ning spaces are filled with structures called disks. The\\ndisks are made up of a tough, fibrous outer tissue with an\\ninner core of elastic or gel-like tissue.\\nOne of the most important functions of disks is pro-\\ntecting the vertebrae and the nerves and blood vessels\\nbetween the vertebrae.

As people age, disks gradu-\\nally become tougher and more unyielding. Disks also\\nshrink with age, which reduces the amount of padding\\nbetween the vertebrae.\\nAs the amount of padding shrinks, the spine loses\\nstability. The vertebrae react by constructing osteo-\\nphytes, commonly known as bone spurs. There are seven\\nvertebrae in the neck; development of osteophytes on\\nthese bones is sometimes called cervical osteoarthritis .\\nOsteophytes may help to stabilize the degenerating back-\\nbone and help protect the spinal cord.\\nBy age 50, 25–50% of people develop cervical spondy-\\nlosis; by 75 years of age, it is seen in at least 70% of people.\\nAlthough shrunken vertebral disks, osteophyte growth, and\\nother changes in their cervical spine may exist, many of\\nthese people never develop significant problems.\\nHowever, about 50% of people over age 50 experience\\nneck pain and stiffness due to cervical spondylosis. Of\\nthese people, 25–40% have at least one episode of cervical\\nradiculopathy, a condition that arises when osteophytes\\ncompress nerves between the vertebrae. Another potential\\nproblem occurs if osteophytes, degenerating disks, or shift-\\ning vertebrae narrow the spinal canal. This pressure com-\\npresses the spinal cord and its blood vessels, causing cervi-\\ncal spondylitic myelopathy, a disorder in which large seg-\\nments of the spinal cord are damaged. This disorder affects\\nfewer than 5% of people with cervical spondylosis. Symp-\\ntoms of both cervical spondylitic myelopathy and cervical\\nradiculopathy may be present in some people.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs people age, shrinkage of the vertebral disks\\nprompts the vertebrae to form osteophytes to stabilize the\\nback bone. However, the position and alignment of the\\ndisks and vertebrae may shift despite the osteophytes.\\nSymptoms may arise from problems with one or more\\ndisks or vertebrae.\\nOsteophyte formation and other changes do not nec-\\nessarily lead to symptoms, but after age 50, half of the\\npopulation experiences occasional neck pain and stiff-\\nness. As disks degenerate, the cervical spine becomes\\nless stable, and the neck is more vulnerable to injuries,\\nincluding muscle and ligament strains. Contact between\\nthe edges of the vertebrae can also cause pain. In some\\npeople, this pain may be referred—that is, perceived as\\noccurring in the head, shoulders, or chest, rather than the\\nneck. Other symptoms may include vertigo (a type of\\ndizziness) or ringing in the ears.\\nThe neck pain and stiffness can be intermittent, as\\ncan symptoms of radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers to\\ncompression on the base, or root, of nerves that lead\\naway from the spinal cord. Normally, these nerves fit\\ncomfortably through spaces between the vertebrae.\\nThese spaces are called intervertebral foramina. As the\\nosteophytes form, they can impinge on this area and\\ngradually make the fit between the vertebrae too snug.\\nThe poor fit increases the chances that a minor inci-\\ndent, such as overdoing normal activities, may place\\nexcess pressure on the nerve root, sometimes referred to\\nas a pinched nerve. Pressure may also accumulate as a\\ndirect consequence of osteophyte formation. The pres-\\nsure on the nerve root causes severe shooting pain in the\\nneck, arms, shoulder, and/or upper back, depending on\\nwhich nerve roots of the cervical spine are affected. The\\npain is often aggravated by movement, but in most cases,\\nsymptoms resolve within four-six weeks.\\nCervical spondylosis can cause cervical spondylitic\\nmyelopathy through stenosis- or osteophyte-related pres-\\nsure on the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of\\nthe spinal canal—the area through the center of the verte-\\nbral column occupied by the spinal cord. Stenosis occurs\\nbecause of misaligned vertebrae and out-of-place or\\ndegenerating disks. The problems created by spondylosis\\ncan be exacerbated if a person has a naturally narrow\\nspinal canal. Pressure against the spinal cord can also be\\ncreated by osteophytes forming on the inner surface of\\nvertebrae and pushing against the spinal cord. Stenosis or\\nosteophytes can compress the spinal cord and its blood\\nvessels, impeding or choking off needed nutrients to the\\nspinal cord cells; in effect, the cells starve to death.\\nWith the death of these cells, the functions that they\\nonce performed are impaired. These functions may\\ninclude conveying sensory information to the brain or\\ntransmitting the brain’s commands to voluntary muscles.\\nPain is usually absent, but a person may experience leg\\nnumbness and an inability to make the legs move proper-\\nly. Other symptoms can include clumsiness and weakness\\nin the hands, stiffness and weakness in the legs, and spon-\\ntaneous twitches in the legs. A person’s ability to walk is\\naffected, and a wide-legged, shuffling gait is sometimes\\nadopted to compensate for the lack of sensation in the\\nlegs and the accompanying, realistic fear of falling. In\\nvery few cases, bladder control becomes a problem.\\nDiagnosis\\nCervical spondylosis is often suspected based on the\\nsymptoms and their history. Careful neurological exami-\\nnation can help determine which nerve roots are involved,\\nbased on the location of the pain and numbness, and the\\npattern of weakness and changes in reflex responses. To\\nconfirm the suspected diagnosis, and to rule out other\\npossibilities, imaging tests are ordered. The first test is an\\nx ray.

The procedure is performed in the\\nUnited States on nearly one of every four babies deliv-\\nered—more than 900,000 babies each year. The proce-\\ndure is often used in cases where the mother has had a\\nprevious c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is the\\nother common cause of c-sections.\\nDifficult labor is commonly caused by one of the\\nthree following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’s\\nbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus; or\\nabnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequent\\ncontractions.\\nAnother major factor is fetal distress, a condition\\nwhere the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal brain\\ndamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-\\ntress is often related to abnormalities in the position of\\nthe fetus or abnormalities in the birth canal, causing\\nreduced blood flow through the placenta. Other condi-\\ntions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginal\\nherpes,hypertension, and diabetes in the mother.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are several ways that obstetricians and other\\ndoctors diagnose conditions that may make a c-section\\nnecessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the positions of the\\nbaby and the placenta and may be used to estimate the\\nbaby’s size and gestational age. Fetal heart monitors, in\\nuse since the 1970s, transmit any signals of fetal distress.\\nOxygen deprivation may be determined by checking the\\namniotic fluid for meconium (feces)—a lack of oxygen\\ncauses an unborn baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivation\\nmay also be determined by testing the pH of a blood\\nsample taken from the baby’s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or high-\\ner is normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, and\\nbelow 7.2 is a sign of trouble.\\nWhen a c-section is being considered because labor\\nis not progressing, the mother should first be encouraged\\nto walk around to stimulate labor.

However, a c-section is safer than a vaginal delivery\\nwhen the baby is 8 lb (3.6 kg) or larger, in a breech posi-\\ntion with the feet crossed, or in a breech position with the\\nhead hyperextended.\\nA woman should receive regular prenatal care and\\nbe able to alert her doctor to the first signs of trouble.\\nOnce labor begins, she should be encouraged to move\\naround and to urinate. The doctor should be conservative\\nin diagnosing dystocia (nonprogressive labor) and fetal\\ndistress, taking a position of “watchful waiting” before\\ndeciding to operate.\\nDescription\\nThe most common reason that a cesarean section is\\nperformed (in 35% of all cases, according to the United\\nStates Public Health Service) is that the woman has had a\\nprevious c-section. The “once a cesarean, always a cesare-\\nan” rule originated when the classical uterine incision was\\nmade vertically; the resulting scar was weak and had a risk\\nof rupturing in subsequent deliveries. Today, the incision is\\nalmost always made horizontally across the lower end of\\nthe uterus (this is called a “low transverse incision”),\\nresulting in reduced blood loss and a decreased chance of\\nrupture. This kind of incision allows many women to have\\na vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC).\\nThe second most common reason that a c-section is\\nperformed (in 30% of all cases) is difficult childbirth\\ndue to nonprogressive labor (dystocia). Uterine contrac-\\nKEY TERMS\\nBreech presentation —The condition in which the\\nbaby enters the birth canal with its buttocks or feet\\nfirst.\\nCephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)—The condi-\\ntion in which the baby’s head is too large to fit\\nthrough the mother’s pelvis.\\nClassical incision—In a cesarean section, an incision\\nmade vertically along the uterus; this kind of incision\\nmakes a larger opening but also creates more bleed-\\ning, a greater chance of infection, and a weaker scar.\\nDystocia—Failure to progress in labor, either\\nbecause the cervix will not dilate (expand) further\\nor (after full dilation) the head does not descend\\nthrough the mother’s pelvis.\\nLow transverse incision—Incision made horizontal-\\nly across the lower end of the uterus; this kind of\\nincision is preferred for less bleeding and stronger\\nhealing.\\nPlacenta previa—The placenta totally or partially\\ncovers the cervix, preventing vaginal delivery.\\nPlacental abruption—Separation of the placenta\\nfrom the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut-\\nting off blood flow to the baby.\\nProlapsed cord—The umbilical cord is pushed into\\nthe vagina ahead of the baby and becomes com-\\npressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS)—Difficulty\\nbreathing, found in infants with immature lungs.\\nTransverse presentation—The baby is laying side-\\nways across the cervix instead of head first.\\nVBAC—Vaginal birth after cesarean.\\ntions may be weak or irregular, the cervix may not be\\ndilating, or the mother’s pelvic structure may not allow\\nadequate passage for birth. When the baby’s head is too\\nlarge to fit through the pelvis, the condition is called\\ncephalopelvic disproportion (CPD).\\nAnother 12% of c-sections are performed to deliver\\na baby in a breech presentation: buttocks or feet first.\\nBreech presentation is found in about 3% of all births.\\nIn 9% of all cases, c-sections are performed in\\nresponse to fetal distress. Fetal distress refers to any situ-\\nation that threatens the baby, such as the umbilical cord\\ngetting wrapped around the baby’s neck. This may\\nappear on the fetal heart monitor as an abnormal heart\\nrate or rhythm.\\nThe remaining 14% of c-sections are indicated by\\nother serious factors. One is prolapse of the umbilical\\ncord: the cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the baby\\nand becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow to the\\nbaby. Another is placental abruption: the placenta sepa-\\nrates from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut-\\nting off blood flow to the baby. The risk of this is espe-\\ncially high in multiple births (twins, triplets, or more). A\\nthird factor is placenta previa : the placenta covers the\\ncervix partially or completely, making vaginal delivery\\nimpossible. In some cases requiring c-section, the baby is\\nin a transverse position, lying horizontally across the\\npelvis, perhaps with a shoulder in the birth canal.\\nThe mother’s health may make delivery by c-section\\nthe safer choice, especially in cases of maternal diabetes,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n725\\nCesarean section'),\n",

A catheter is inserted into her blad-\\nder and an intravenous (IV) line is inserted into her arm.\\nLeads for monitoring the mother’s heart rate, rhythm,\\nand blood pressure are attached. In the operating room,\\nthe mother is given anesthesia—usually a regional anes-\\nthetic (epidural or spinal), making her numb from below\\nher breasts to her toes. In some cases, a general anesthet-\\nic will be administered. Surgical drapes are placed over\\nthe body, except the head; these drapes block the direct\\nview of the procedure.\\nThe abdomen is washed with an anti-bacterial solu-\\ntion and a portion of the pubic hair may be shaved. The\\nfirst incision opens the abdomen. Infrequently, it will be\\nvertical from just below the navel to the top of the pubic\\nbone, or more commonly, it will be a horizontal incision\\nacross and above the pubic bone (informally called a\\n“bikini cut”).\\nThe second incision opens the uterus. In most cases\\na transverse incision is made. This is the favored type\\nbecause it heals well and makes it possible for a woman\\nto attempt a vaginal delivery in the future. The classical\\nincision is vertical. Because it provides a larger opening\\nthan a low transverse incision, it is used in the most criti-\\ncal situations, such as placenta previa. However, the clas-\\nsical incision causes more bleeding, a greater risk of\\nabdominal infection, and a weaker scar, so the low trans-\\nverse incision is preferred.\\nOnce the uterus is opened, the amniotic sac is rup-\\ntured and the baby is delivered. The time from the initial\\nincision to birth is typically five minutes.\\nOnce the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the new-\\nborn is evaluated. The placenta is removed from the\\nmother, and her uterus and abdomen are stitched closed\\n(surgical staples may be used instead in closing the outer-\\nmost layer of the abdominal incision). From birth through\\nsuturing may take 30–40 minutes. Thus the entire surgical\\nprocedure may be performed in less than one hour.\\nAftercare\\nA woman who undergoes a c-section requires both\\nthe care given to any new mother and the care given to\\nany patient recovering from major surgery. She should be\\noffered pain medication that does not interfere with\\nbreastfeeding. She should be encouraged to get out of bed\\nand walk around eight to 24 hours after surgery to stimu-\\nlate circulation (thus avoiding the formation of blood\\nclots) and bowel movement. She should limit climbing\\nstairs to once a day, and avoid lifting anything heavier\\nthan the baby. She should nap as often as the baby sleeps,\\nand arrange for help with the housework, meals, and care\\nof other children. She may resume driving after two\\nweeks, although some doctors recommend waiting for six\\nweeks, the typical recovery period from major surgery.\\nRisks\\nBecause a c-section is a surgical procedure, it carries\\nmore risk to both the mother and the baby. The maternal\\ndeathrate is less than 0.02%, but that is four times the\\nmaternal death rate associated with vaginal delivery.\\nHowever, many women have a c-section for serious med-\\nical problems. The mother is at risk for increased bleeding\\n(because a c-section may result in twice the blood loss of\\na vaginal delivery) from the two incisions, the placental\\nattachment site, and possible damage to a uterine artery.\\nComplications occur in less than 10% of cases. The moth-\\ner may develop infection of either incision, the urinary\\ntract, or the tissue lining the uterus (endometritis). Less\\ncommonly, she may receive injury to the surrounding\\norgans, like the bladder and bowel. When a general anes-\\nthesia is used, she may experience complications from the\\nanesthesia. Very rarely, she may develop a wound\\nhematoma at the site of either incision or other blood clots\\nleading to pelvic thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the\\nmajor vein running from the pelvis into the leg) or a pul-\\nmonary embolus (a blood clot lodging in the lung).\\nNormal results\\nThe after-effects of a c-section vary, depending on\\nthe woman’s age, physical fitness, and overall health.\\nFollowing this procedure, a woman commonly experi-\\nences gas pains, incision pain, and uterine contractions—\\nwhich are also common in vaginal delivery. Her hospital\\nstay may be two to four days. Breastfeeding the baby is\\nencouraged, taking care that it is in a position that keeps\\nthe baby from resting on the mother’s incision. As the\\nwoman heals, she may gradually increase appropriate\\nexercises to regain abdominal tone. Full recovery may be\\nseen in four to six weeks.\\nThe prognosis for a successful vaginal birth after a\\ncesarean (VBAC) may be at least 75%, especially when the\\nc-section involved a low transverse incision in the uterus\\nand there were no complications during or after delivery.\\nAbnormal results\\nOf the hundreds of thousands of women in the Unit-\\ned States who undergo a c-section each year, about 500\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n726\\nCesarean section'),\n",

She may feel iso-\\nlated if the father or birthing coach is not with her in the\\noperating room, or if she is treated by an unfamiliar doc-\\ntor rather than by her own doctor or midwife. She may\\nfeel helpless from a loss of control over labor and deliv-\\nery with no opportunity to actively participate. To over-\\ncome these feelings, the woman must understand why\\nthe c-section was necessary. She must accept that she\\ncouldn’t control the unforeseen events that made the c-\\nsection the optimum means of delivery, and recognize\\nthat preserving the health and safety of both her and her\\nchild was more important than her delivering vaginally.\\nWomen who undergo a c-section should be encouraged\\nto share their feelings with others. Hospitals can often\\nrecommend support groups for such mothers.

It\\ninvolves damage to the nerves that control the heart,\\ndigestive and other organs, and eventually leads to dam-\\nage to these organs. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease affects\\nover 15 million persons, and kills 50,000 each year.\\nResearchers believe that the parasite that causes the dis-\\nease is only found in the Americas.\\nDescription\\nWhen a person is infected with Chagas’ disease, the\\nparasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi first causes a mild,\\nshort-lived period of “acute” illness; then after a long\\nperiod without symptoms, the effects of the infection\\nbegin to appear. The heart, esophagus, and colon are\\nmost frequently involved. These organs become unable\\nto contract properly, and begin to stretch or dilate.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nT. cruziis carried by insects or bugs known as redu-\\nviid or “kissing bugs.” These insects are very common in\\nCentral and South America where they inhabit poorly\\nconstructed houses and huts. The insects deposit their\\nwaste material, exposing inhabitants to the parasites. The\\nparasites then enter the body by way of a cut or via the\\neyes or mouth. T. cruzi can also be transmitted by blood\\ntransfusion . Eating uncooked, contaminated food or\\nbreastfeeding can also transmit the disease. The reduvi-\\nids, in turn, become infected with the parasite by biting\\ninfected animals and humans.\\nThere are three phases related to infection:\\n• Acute phase lasts about two months, with non-specific\\nsymptoms of low grade fever, headache, fatigue, and\\nenlarged liver or spleen.\\n• Indeterminate phase lasts 10–20 years, during which\\ntime no symptoms occur, but the parasites are repro-\\nducing in various organs.\\n• Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to\\ndamage of major organs (heart, esophagus, colon) begin.\\nIn the chronic phase, irregularities of heart rhythm,\\nheart failure, and blood clots cause weakness, fainting,\\nand even sudden death.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 727\\nChagas’ disease'),\n",

Chan-\\ncroid is a sexually transmitted disease, which means that\\nit is spread from person to person almost always by sexu-\\nal contact. However, there have been a few cases in\\nwhich healthcare providers have become infected\\nthrough contact with infected patients.\\nCommon locations for chancroid sores (ulcers) in\\nmen are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin, the\\ngroove behind the head of the penis, the opening of the\\npenis, and the scrotum. In women, common locations are\\nthe labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips),\\nperianal area (area around the anal opening), and inner\\nthighs. It is rare for the ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal walls\\nor cervix. In about 50% of the patients with chancroid,\\nthe infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodes\\nin the groin.\\nChancroid is most commonly found in developing\\nand third world countries. In the United States, the most\\ncommon cause of genital ulcers is genital herpes , fol-\\nlowed by syphilis, and then chancroid. As of 1997, there\\nwere fewer than 1,500 cases of chancroid in the United\\nStates per year and it occurred primarily in African\\nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans.\\nThere are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid in\\nthe United States. In addition, the practice of exchanging\\nsex for drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine\\nuse and chancroid.\\nEven though the incidence of chancroid in the United\\nStates decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming con-\\nnection between chancroid and human immunodeficien-\\ncy virus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired\\nimmunodeficiency syndrome) and is easily spread from\\nperson to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircum-\\ncised men with chancroid ulcers have a 48% risk of\\nacquiring HIV from sexual contact. Women with chan-\\ncroid ulcers are also at a greater risk of being infected\\nwith HIV during sexual contact. Genital ulcers seem to\\nact as doorways for HIV to enter and exit.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHaemophilus ducreyiis spread from person to per-\\nson by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum-\\ncised men are about three times more likely than circum-\\ncised men to become infected following exposure to\\nHaemophilus ducreyi. Having unprotected sex, exchang-\\ning sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with a\\nprostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroid\\nin the United States occur in persons who had traveled to\\ncountries where the disease is more common.\\nChancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene-\\ntrates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut.\\nOnce past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and\\nnutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign of\\nchancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within three\\nto seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but may\\ntake up to one month. Usually within one day, the papule\\nbecomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleeds\\neasily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharply\\ndefined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from an\\neighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usually\\nhave only one ulcer, but women often have four or more.\\nSometimes “kissing” ulcers occur when one ulcer\\nspreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur-\\nface. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips of\\nthe labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have any\\nexternal sores but may experience painful urination,\\nintercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have a\\nvaginal discharge or rectal bleeding.\\nSigns that the infection has spread to the lymph node\\nappear about one week after the formation of the genital\\nulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphatic\\nsystem that filter waste materials from nearly every\\norgan in the body. This lymph node infection is called\\n“lymphadenitis” and the swollen, painful lymph node is\\ncalled a “bubo.” The bubo, which appears as a red, spher-\\nical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thick\\npus and forming another ulcer.\\nDiagnosis\\nChancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urolo-\\ngists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (for\\nwomen), and infectious disease specialists. Part of the\\ndiagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital herpes\\nand syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms of\\nthese diseases.

However, the pres-\\nence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a\\ngenital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.\\nFor a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus\\nducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster-\\nile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus\\nsample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special\\nmedia and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi\\ntakes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In\\naddition, the pus may be examined under the microscope\\nto see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus\\nmay also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A\\nblood sample will probably be taken from the patient’s\\narm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria\\nthat causes syphilis.\\nTreatment\\nThe only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given\\neither once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth\\nfor one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin,\\nEry-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin),\\nco-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin\\n(Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone\\n(Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or\\nofloxacin (Floxin).\\nThe ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce\\nthe swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to\\nthe ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre-\\nvent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin\\nmay require circumcision .

However, charcoal\\nwas almost forgotten until 15 years ago when it was\\nrediscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over-\\ndoses and toxins.\\nDescription\\nActivated charcoal’s most important use is for treat-\\nment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption of\\nmost poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. In\\naddition to being used for most swallowed poisons in\\nhumans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rab-\\nbits, rats, and other animals, as well. It can also adsorb\\ngas in the bowels and has been used for the treatment of\\ngas or diarrhea. Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment\\nof viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snake\\nvenoms and other substances by adsorption have not\\nbeen supported by clinical studies. By adding water to\\nthe powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can be\\nused as an external application to alleviate pain and itch-\\ning from bites and stings.\\nPoisons and drug overdoses\\nIt is estimated that one million children accidentally\\noverdose on drugs mistaken as candies or eat, drink, or\\ninhale poisonous household products each year. Infants\\nand toddlers are at the greatest risk for accidental poison-\\ning. Activated charcoal is one of the agents most com-\\nmonly used for these cases. It can absorb large amounts of\\npoisons quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be stored\\nfor a long time, and can be conveniently administered at\\nhome. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic\\nsubstances in the stomach and intestines. This prevents\\nthe toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout the\\nbody. The activated charcoal with the toxic substance\\nbound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm to\\nthe body. When poisoning is suspected the local poison\\ncontrol center should be contacted for instructions. They\\nmay recommend using activated charcoal, which should\\nbe available at home so that it can be given to the poi-\\nsoned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning,\\nseveral doses of activated charcoal may be needed.\\nIntestinal disorders\\nIn the past, activated charcoal was a popular remedy\\nfor gas. Even before the discovery of America by Euro-\\npeans, Native Americans used powdered charcoal mixed\\nwith water to treat an upset stomach. Now charcoal is\\nbeing rediscovered as an alternative treatment for this con-\\ndition. Activated charcoal works like a sponge. Its huge\\nsurface area is ideal for soaking up different substances,\\nincluding gas. In one study, people taking activated char-\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntidote —A remedy to counteract a poison or\\ninjury.\\nAdsorption—The binding of a chemical (e.g., drug\\nor poison) to a solid material such as activated\\ncharcoal or clay.\\ncoal after eating a meal with high gas-producing foods did\\nnot produce more gas than those who did not have these\\nfoods. Charcoal has also been used to treat other intestinal\\ndisorders such as diarrhea,constipation, and cramps.\\nThere are few studies to support these uses and there are\\nalso concerns that frequent use of charcoal may decrease\\nabsorption of essential nutrients, especially in children.\\nOther uses\\nBesides being a general antidote for poisons or reme-\\ndy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat other\\nconditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or bind\\nto other substances, charcoal has been effectively used to\\nclean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials from the\\ngastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used to\\nadsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and harmful\\nmaterials excreted by bacteria or fungi. However, because\\nof lack of scientific studies, these uses are not recom-\\nmended. Activated charcoal, when used together with\\nother remedies such as aloe vera, acidophilus, and psylli-\\num, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under\\ncontrol. While charcoal shows some anti-aging activity in\\nrats, it is doubtful if it can do the same for humans.\\nRecommended dosage\\nFor poisoning\\nActivated charcoal is available without prescription.\\nHowever, in case of accidental poisoning or drug overdose\\nan emergency poison control center, hospital emergency\\nroom, or doctor’s office should be called for advice. In case\\nthat both syrup of ipecac and charcoal are recommended\\nfor treatment of the poison, ipecac should be given first.\\nCharcoal should not be given for at least 30 minutes after\\nipecac or until vomiting from ipecac stops.

It is also known\\nas hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some-\\ntimes called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to the\\nmuscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onset\\nof CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the\\n50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. For\\nreasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can also\\nvary greatly, even among members of the same family.\\nAlthough CMT has been described for many years,\\nit is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause of\\nmany of the types of CMT have become known. There-\\nfore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramatically\\nwithin a short time.\\nThe peripheral nerves\\nCMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of\\nnerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal\\ncord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry\\nmotor commands to muscles, especially those furthest\\nfrom the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a\\nresult, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually\\nweaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry\\ninformation from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-\\nple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-\\ntoms such as not being able to tell if something is hot or\\ncold or difficulties with balance.\\nThere are two parts of the nerve that can be affected\\nin CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in\\nwhich the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-\\nlation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of the\\nmyelin is to help messages travel very fast through the\\nnerves. CMT is usually classified depending on which\\npart of the nerve is affected. People who have problems\\nwith the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who have\\nabnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.\\nSpecialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-\\nduction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine if\\na person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure the\\nspeed at which messages travel through the nerves. In\\nCMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 the\\nmessages travel at the normal speed.\\nDemographics\\nCMT has been diagnosed in people from all over the\\nworld. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500 people,\\nwhich is about the same incidence as multiple sclerosis. It\\nis the most common type of inherited neurologic condition.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nCMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of\\na number of genes that carry the instructions to make the\\nperipheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for how\\nthe body grows and develops before and after a person is\\nborn. There are probably at least 15 different genes that\\ncan cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many have\\nnot yet been identified.\\nCMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-\\ntypes based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-\\ntypes are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,\\netc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causes\\nCMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B.\\nTypes of CMT\\nCMT1A.The most common type of CMT is called\\nCMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene called\\nperipheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on chro-\\nmosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a protein\\n(PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin. In most people\\nwho have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition is\\na duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead of\\nhaving two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro-\\nmosome) there are three copies. It is not known how this\\nextra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp-\\ntoms. A small percentage of people with CMT1A do not\\nhave a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have a\\npoint mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a typo\\nin the gene that causes it to work incorrectly.\\nHEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRES-\\nSURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is also\\ncaused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The mutation\\nis a deletion. Therefore, there is only one copy of the\\nPMP22 gene instead of two. People who have HNPP\\nmay have some of the signs of CMT. However, they also\\nhave episodes where they develop weakness and prob-\\nlems with sensation after compression of certain pressure\\npoints such as the elbows or knee. Often these symptoms\\nwill resolve after a few days or weeks, but sometimes\\nthey are permanent.\\nCMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is\\ncaused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein zero\\n(MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this gene is\\nto make the layers of myelin stick together as they are\\nwrapped around the axon. The mutations in this gene are\\npoint mutations because they involve a change (either\\ndeletion, substitution, or insertion) at one specific com-\\nponent of a gene.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n733\\nCharcot Marie Tooth disease'),\n",

Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is usu-\\nally considered a subtype of CMT1 because it affects the\\nmyelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type\\n1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT-causing gene is located\\non the X chromosome and is called connexin 32 (Cx32).\\nThe job of this gene is to code for a class of protein called\\nconnexins that form tunnels between the layers of myelin.\\nCMT2. There are at least five different genes that can\\ncause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes A, B,\\nC, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have narrowed in\\non the location of most of the CMT2 causing genes.\\nHowever, the specific genes and the mutations have not\\nyet been found for most types. Very recently, the gene for\\nCMT2E has been found. The gene is called neurofila-\\nment-light (NF-L). Because it has just been discovered,\\nnot much is known about how mutations in this gene\\ncause CMT.\\nCMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas\\ndisease was referred to as CMT3. This is a severe type of\\nCMT in which symptoms begin in infancy or early child-\\nhood. It is now known that this is not a separate type of\\nCMT and in fact people who have onset in infancy or\\nearly childhood often have mutations in the PMP22 or\\nMPZ genes.\\nCMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the\\nnerve conduction tests have slow response results. Howev-\\ner, it is classified differently from CMT1 because it is\\npassed through families by a different pattern of inheri-\\ntance. There are five different subtypes and each has only\\nbeen described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4\\nare often severe and other symptoms such as deafness may\\nbe present. There are three different genes that have been\\nassociated with CMT4 as of early 2001. They are called\\nMTMR2, EGR2, and NDRG1. More research is required\\nto understand how mutations in these genes cause CMT.\\nInheritance\\nCMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of\\nCMT2 have autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomal\\nrefers to the first 22 pairs of chromosomes that are the\\nsame in males and females. Therefore, males and\\nfemales are affected equally in these types. In a dominant\\ncondition, only one gene of a pair needs to have a muta-\\ntion in order for a person to have symptoms of the condi-\\ntion. Therefore, anyone who has these types has a 50%,\\nor one in two, chance of passing CMT on to each of their\\nchildren. This chance is the same for each pregnancy\\nand does not change based on previous children.\\nCMTX has X-linked inheritance. Since males only\\nhave one X chromosome, they only have one copy of the\\nCx32 gene. Thus, when a male has a mutation in his Cx32\\ngene, he will have CMT. However, females have two X\\nchromosomes and therefore have two copies of the Cx32\\ngene. If they have a mutation in one copy of their Cx32\\ngenes, they will only have mild to moderate symptoms of\\nCMT that may go unnoticed. This is because their normal\\ncopy of the Cx32 gene does make normal myelin.\\nFemales pass on one or the other of their X chromo-\\nsomes to their children—sons or daughters. If a woman\\nwith a Cx32 mutation passes her normal X chromosome,\\nshe will have an unaffected son or daughter who will not\\npass CMT on to his or her children. If the woman passes\\nthe chromosome with Cx32 mutation on she will have an\\naffected son or daughter, although the daughter will be\\nmildly affected or have no symptoms. Therefore, a woman\\nwith a Cx32 mutation has a 50%, or a one in two, chance\\nof passing the mutation to her children: a son will be\\naffected, and a daughter may only have mild symptoms.\\nWhen males pass on an X chromosome, they have a\\ndaughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they have\\na son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the X chromosome,\\na man with CMTX will always pass the Cx32 mutation\\non to his daughters. However, when he has a son, he\\npasses on the Y chromosome, and therefore the son will\\nnot be affected. Therefore, an affected male passes the\\nCx32 gene mutation on to all of his daughters, but to\\nnone of his sons.\\nCMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males\\nand females are equally affected. In order for a person to\\nhave CMT4, they must have a mutation in both of their\\nCMT-causing genes—one inherited from each parent.\\nThe parents of an affected person are called carriers.\\nThey have one normal copy of the gene and one copy\\nwith a mutation. Carriers do not have symptoms of CMT.\\nTwo carrier parents have a 25%, or one in four, chance of\\npassing CMT on to each of their children.\\nThe onset of symptoms is highly variable, even\\namong members of the same family. Symptoms usually\\nprogress very slowly over a person’s lifetime. The main\\nproblems caused by CMT are weakness and loss of sen-\\nsation mainly in the feet and hands. The first symptoms\\nare usually problems with the feet such as high arches\\nand problems with walking and running. Tripping while\\nwalking and sprained ankles are common. Muscle loss in\\nthe feet and calves leads to “foot drop” where the foot\\ndoes not lift high enough off the ground when walking.\\nComplaints of cold legs are common, as are cramps in\\nthe legs, especially after exercise.\\nIn many people, the fingers and hands eventually\\nbecome affected. Muscle loss in the hands can make fine\\nmovements such as working buttons and zippers difficult.\\nSome patients develop tremor in the upper limbs.

Most people\\nwith CMT remain able to walk throughout their lives.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological\\nexam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. A\\nthorough family history should be taken at this time to deter-\\nmine if other people in the family are affected. Testing may\\nalso be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy.\\nA nerve conduction velocity test should be per-\\nformed to measure how fast impulses travel through the\\nnerves. This test may show characteristic features of\\nCMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction\\ntesting may be combined with electromyography\\n(EMG), an electrical test of the muscles.\\nA nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the\\nnerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris-\\ntic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic of\\nCMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis.\\nDefinitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet-\\nic testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount\\nof blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detect\\nmutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However,\\nresearch is progressing rapidly and new testing is often\\nmade available every few months. All affected members\\nof a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once a\\nmutation is found in one affected member, it is possible\\nto test other members who may have symptoms or are at\\nrisk of developing CMT.\\nPrenatal diagnosis\\nTesting during pregnancy to determine whether an\\nunborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a\\nfamily has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation.\\nThis can be done after 10–12 weeks of pregnancy using a\\nprocedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS\\ninvolves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam-\\nining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente-\\nsis after 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount\\nof the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing\\nthe cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a small\\nrisk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are\\ninterested in learning more should check with their doctor\\nor genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options\\nshould obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all\\nof the benefits and limitations of these procedures.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for CMT. However, physical and\\noccupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat-\\nment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motion\\nand minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, or\\ncontracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control\\nof the lower extremities that can help tremendously with\\nbalance. After wearing braces, people often find that they\\nhave more energy because they are using less energy to\\nfocus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used to\\nprovide devices and techniques that can assist tasks such\\nas dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of\\ndaily life. V oice-activated software can also help people\\nwho have problems with fine motor control.\\nIt is very important that people with CMT avoid\\ninjury that causes them to be immobile for long periods\\nof time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to return\\nto their original strength after injury.\\nThere is a long list of medications that should be\\navoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such as\\nhydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and\\nD, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com-\\nplete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo-\\nple considering taking any of these medications should\\nweigh the risks and benefits with their physician.\\nPrognosis\\nThe symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over\\nmany years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy.\\nThe majority of people with CMT do not need to use a\\nwheelchair during their lifetime.

Krajewski, MS, CGC\\nCharcot’s joints\\nDefinition\\nCharcot’s joints is a progressive degenerative disease\\nof the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss of\\nability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint.\\nDescription\\nCharcot’s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis-\\nease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint.\\nThe first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due\\nto nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the\\njoint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the\\njoint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small\\ninjuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until\\nfinally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro-\\ntective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration\\nof the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint.\\nAlthough this condition can affect any joint, the\\nknee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals\\nwith diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly\\naffected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may\\naffect two or three joints. More than three affected joints\\nis very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected\\ndepends on the location of the nerve damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil-\\nity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus,\\nspinal injuries and diseases,alcoholism, and even syphilis\\ncan all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some\\nareas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital.\\nThe symptoms of Charcot’s joints can go unnoticed\\nfor some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis\\nin the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without\\nthe expected pain, or with less pain than would be\\nexpected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As\\nthe condition progresses, however, the joint can become\\nvery painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths.\\nDiagnosis\\nCharcot’s joints is suspected when a person with a\\ndisease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless\\nswelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will\\nshow damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal\\nbone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag-\\nments from previous injuries may also be visible.\\nTreatment\\nIn the early stages of Charcot’s joints, braces to sta-\\nbilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage.\\nWhen the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgery\\ncan sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten-\\nsive, an artificial joint may be necessary.\\nPrognosis\\nTreatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep-\\ntion may help to slow the damage to the joints.\\nPrevention\\nPreventing or effectively managing the underlying\\ndisease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage,\\nbut the condition cannot be prevented.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nResnick, Donald.

Proponents claim it also treats\\ncoronary artery diseaseand other illnesses that may be\\nlinked to damage from free radicals (reactive molecules).\\nPurpose\\nThe benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of\\nlead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are\\nundisputed. The claims of benefits for those suffering\\nfrom atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and other\\ndegenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report-\\ned uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi-\\nna, gangrene, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s\\ndisease, psoriasis , and Alzheimer’s disease . Improve-\\nment is also claimed for people experiencing diminished\\nsight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nThe term chelation is from the Greek root word\\n“chele,” meaning “claw.” Chelating agents, most com-\\nmonly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were originally\\ndesigned for industrial applications in the early 1900s. It\\nwas not until the World War II era that the potential for\\nmedical therapy was realized. The initial intent was to\\ndevelop antidotes to poison gas and radioactive contami-\\nnants. The need for widespread therapy of this nature did\\nnot materialize, but more practical uses were found for\\nchelation. During the following decade, EDTA chelation\\ntherapy became standard treatment for people suffering\\nfrom lead poisoning . Patients who had received this\\ntreatment claimed to have other health improvements\\nthat could not be attributed to the lead removal only.\\nEspecially notable were comments from those who had\\npreviously suffered from intermittent claudication and\\nangina. They reported suffering less pain and fatigue ,\\nwith improved endurance, after chelation therapy. These\\nreports stimulated further interest in the potential bene-\\nfits of chelation therapy for people suffering from athero-\\nsclerosis and coronary artery disease.\\nIf the preparatory examination suggests that there is a\\ncondition that could be improved by chelation therapy, and\\nthere is no health reason why it shouldn’t be used, then the\\ntreatment can begin. The patient is generally taken to a\\ncomfortable treatment area, sometimes in a group loca-\\ntion, and an intravenous line is started. A solution of\\nEDTA together with vitamins and minerals tailored for\\nthe individual patient is given. Most treatments take three\\nto four hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in order\\nto be safe. The number of recommended treatments is usu-\\nally between 20 and 40. They are given one to three times\\na week. Maintenance treatments can then be given at the\\nrate of once or twice a month. Maximum benefits are\\nreportedly attained after approximately three months after\\na treatment series. The cost of therapy is considerable, but\\nit is a fraction of the cost of an expensive medical proce-\\ndure like cardiac bypass surgery. Intravenous vitamin C\\nand mercury chelation therapies are also offered.\\nPreparations\\nA candidate for chelation therapy should initially\\nhave a thorough history and physical to define the type and\\nextent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be done\\nto determine whether there are any conditions present that\\nwould prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have pre-\\nexisting hypocalcemia, poor liver or kidney function, con-\\ngestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, clot-\\nting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are at\\nhigher risk for complications from chelation therapy. A\\nDoppler ultrasound may be performed to determine the\\nadequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is important for people who receive chelation ther-\\napy to work with medical personnel who are experienced\\nin the use of this treatment. Treatment should not be\\nundertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation,\\nhistory, and any laboratory tests necessary are per-\\nformed. The staff must be forthcoming about test results\\nand should answer any questions the patient may have.\\nEvaluation and treatment should be individualized and\\ninvolve assessment of kidney function before each treat-\\nment with chelation, since the metals bound by the\\nEDTA are excreted through the kidneys.\\nAlthough EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like\\nmercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essential\\nnutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc,\\nand magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are lost during\\nchelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired immune\\nfunction and other harmful effects. Supplements of zinc\\nare generally given to patients undergoing chelation, but\\nit is not known whether this is adequate to prevent defi-\\nciency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace proper\\nnutrition, exercise , and appropriate medications or\\nsurgery for specific diseases or conditions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n737\\nChelation therapy'),\n",

Herniated disks are the\\ncause of only a small proportion of cases of lower back\\npain, and chemonucleolysis is appropriate for only some\\ncases of HNP.\\nChemonucleolysis is a conservative alternative to\\ndisk surgery. There are three types of disk injuries. A\\nprotruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In an\\nextruded disk, the fibrous wrapper has torn and the NP\\nhas oozed out, but is still connected to the disk. In a\\nsequestered disk, a fragment of the NP has broken loose\\nfrom the disk and is free in the spinal canal. Chemonu-\\ncleolysis is effective on protruded and extruded disks,\\nbut not on sequestered disk injuries. In the United\\nStates, chymopapain chemonucleolysis is approved\\nonly for use in the lumbar (lower) spine. In other coun-\\ntries, it has also been used successfully to treat cervical\\n(upper spine) hernias.\\nOther indications that a patient is a good candidate\\nfor chemonucleolysis instead of surgery include:\\n• the patient is 18–50 years of age\\n• leg pain is worse than lower back pain\\n• other conservative treatments have failed\\n• the spot where the herniated disk presses on the nerve\\nhas been pinpointed by myelography , computed\\ntomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI)\\n• the patient wishes to avoid surgery\\nPrecautions\\nThere are some situations in which chemonucleoly-\\nsis should not be performed. Chymopapain is derived\\nfrom the papaya. About 0.3% of patients are allergic to\\nchymopapain and go into life-threatening shock when\\nexposed to the enzyme.

It is usually used to treat patients with cancer that\\nhas spread from the place in the body where it started\\n(metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any-\\nwhere in the body. It even kills cells that have broken off\\nfrom the main tumor and traveled through the blood or\\nlymph systems to other parts of the body.\\nChemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In\\nsome cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cells\\nor to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of the\\nbody. When a cancer has been removed by surgery,\\nchemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com-\\ning back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can ease\\nthe symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have a\\nbetter quality of life.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are many different types of chemotherapy\\ndrugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treating\\ncancer, determine which drugs are best suited for\\neach patient. This decision is based on the type of\\ncancer, the patient’s age and health, and other drugs\\nthe patient is taking. Some patients should not be\\ntreated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age and\\nother conditions may affect the drugs with which a\\nperson may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease,\\nand diabetes are conditions that may limit the choice\\nof treatment drugs.\\nDescription\\nMore than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently\\navailable to treat cancer and many more are being tested\\nfor their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera-\\npy drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul-\\ntiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body,\\nmany useful treatments are most effective against rapidly\\ngrowing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than most\\nother body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of the\\nbone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom-\\nach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There-\\nfore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy are\\nlinked to their effects on other fast growing cells.\\nTypes of chemotherapy drugs\\nChemotherapy drugs are classified based on how\\nthey work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are\\ndescribed below:\\n• Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking\\nDNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos-\\nphamide is an alkylating drug.\\n• Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA\\nand keep cells from growing and multiplying. An\\nexample of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).\\n• Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub-\\nstances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with\\nimportant cell functions, including production of DNA\\nand cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong to\\nthis group of chemotherapy drugs.\\n• Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally.\\nVinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtained\\nfrom the periwinkle plant.\\n• Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that\\ndepend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is used\\nto treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone\\nestrogen for growth.\\nCombination chemotherapy\\nChemotherapy is usually given in addition to other\\ncancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy.\\nWhen given with other treatments, it is called adjuvant\\nchemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera-\\npy drug or combination of drugs will work best for each\\npatient. The use of two or more drugs together often works\\nbetter than a single drug for treating cancer. This is called\\ncombination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different\\ndrug combinations help doctors learn which combinations\\nwork best for each type of cancer.\\nHow chemotherapy is given\\nChemotherapy is administered in different ways,\\ndepending on the drugs to be given and the type of can-\\ncer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con-\\nsidering many factors, among them being the patient’s\\nheight and weight.\\nChemotherapy may be given by one or more of the\\nfollowing methods:\\n• orally\\n• by injection\\n• through a catheter or port\\n• topically\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n740\\nChemotherapy'),\n",

This is the easiest method and can\\nusually be done at home.\\nIntravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a\\nvein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand or\\nlower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tube\\ncalled a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needle\\nfrom an IV bag or bottle.\\nIntramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a\\nmuscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injection\\nis absorbed into the blood more slowly than IV\\nchemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IM\\nchemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy given\\nintravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub-\\ncutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin.\\nInjection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer is\\ncalled intralesional (IL) injection.\\nChemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or\\nport permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav-\\nity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placed\\nin a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug will\\nbe given. These methods eliminate the need for repeated\\ninjections and may allow patients to spend less time in\\nthe hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A common\\nlocation for a permanent catheter is the external jugular\\nvein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is\\nadministered into the abdominal cavity through a\\ncatheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or port\\ninto the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra-\\ntion.

This method is more\\ncommon in treatment of certain types of skin cancer.\\nTreatment location and schedule\\nPatients may take chemotherapy at home, in the doc-\\ntor’s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the hospi-\\ntal. Most patients stay in the hospital when first begin-\\nning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for any\\nside effects and change the dose if needed.\\nHow often and how long chemotherapy is given\\ndepends on the type of cancer, how patients respond to\\nthe drugs, patients’ health and ability to tolerate the\\ndrugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapy\\nadministration may take only a few minutes or may last\\nas long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be given\\ndaily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may follow a\\ncourse of treatment before the next course begins.

Sometimes a procedure called thora-\\ncentesis is performed in an effort to avoid inserting a\\nchest drainage tube. In this procedure a needle with a\\ncatheter is inserted into the pleural space and fluid is\\nremoved. When fluid continues to accumulate, chest\\ndrainage therapy is usually the next step. This is especial-\\nly true when there is a lung infection underlying the fluid\\nbuild-up.\\nPrecautions\\nChest drainage therapy is not done if a collapsed\\nlung is not life-threatening. It also should be avoided for\\npatients who have blood clotting problems.\\nDescription\\nMost patients are awake when the chest drainage\\ntube is inserted. They are given a sedative and a local\\nanesthetic. Chest drainage tubes are usually inserted\\nbetween the ribs. The exact location depends on the type\\nof material to be drained and its location in the lungs.\\nAn incision is made in the skin and through the mus-\\ncles between the ribs. A chest tube is inserted and\\nsecured in place. The doctor connects one end of the tube\\nto the chest drainage system.\\nThe chest drainage system must remain sealed to\\nprevent air from entering the chest cavity through the\\ntube. One commonly used system is a water-seal\\ndrainage system, comprised of three compartments that\\ncollect and drain the fluid or air without allowing air to\\nbackflow into the tube. An alternative to this system is to\\nconnect the tube to a negative suction pump.\\nOnce the tube and drainage system are in place, a\\nchest x ray is done to confirm that the tube is in the right\\nlocation, and that it is working.

Sometimes fluid becomes\\ntrapped in isolated spaces in the lung, and it is necessary\\nto do an ultrasound to determine where to locate the\\ndrainage tube. Computed tomography scans (CT) are\\nuseful in locating small pockets of fluids caused by can-\\ncer or tuberculosis.\\nAftercare\\nNormally after the material has been removed\\nfrom the chest cavity and the situation is resolved, the\\nchest drainage tube is removed. In cases where the rea-\\nson for the tube was air in the pleural cavity, the tube is\\nclamped and left in place several hours before it is\\nremoved to make sure no more air is leaking into the\\nspace. If the patient is on mechanical ventilation, the\\ntube is often left in place until a respirator is no longer\\nnecessary.

Chest physi-\\ncal therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion,\\nchest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, and\\ncoughing. It is usually done in conjunction with other\\ntreatments to rid the airways of secretions. These other\\ntreatments include suctioning, nebulizer treatments, and\\nthe administration of expectorant drugs.\\nChest physical therapy can be used with newborns,\\ninfants, children, and adults. People who benefit from\\nchest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of problems\\nthat make it difficult to clear secretions from their lungs.\\nSome people who may receive chest physical therapy\\ninclude people with cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular dis-\\neases like Guillain-Barré syndrome , progressive mus-\\ncle weakness ( myasthenia gravis ), or tetanus . People\\nwith lung diseases such as bronchitis , pneumonia ,o r\\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also ben-\\nefit from chest physical therapy.

Different\\npatient conditions warrant different levels of training.\\nChest physical therapy consists of a variety of proce-\\ndures that are applied depending on the patient’s health\\nand condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated fre-\\nquently to establish which procedures are most effective\\nand best tolerated. Patients receiving long term chest phys-\\nical therapy are reevaluated about every three months.\\nTurning\\nTurning from side to side permits lung expansion.\\nPatients may turn themselves or be turned by a caregiver.\\nThe head of the bed is also elevated to promote drainage\\nif the patient can tolerate this position. Critically ill\\npatients and those dependent on mechanical respiration\\nare turned once every one to two hours around the clock.\\nCoughing\\nCoughing helps break up secretions in the lungs so\\nthat the mucus can be suctioned out or expectorated.\\nPatients sit upright and inhale deeply through the nose.\\nThey then exhale in short puffs or coughs.

X rays are a form of radiation\\nthat can penetrate the body and produce an image on an\\nx-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph.\\nPurpose\\nChest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag-\\nnostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent-\\nly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are ordered\\nfor a single check of an organ’s condition, and at other\\ntimes, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previous\\nstudies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include:\\nPulmonary disorders\\nChest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or\\nrule out pneumonia. Other pulmonary disorders such as\\nemphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in\\nthe chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected or\\nevaluated through the use of chest x ray.\\nCancer\\nA chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to\\ncheck for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoid\\ntissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primary\\ntumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can-\\ncer from one organ to another.\\nCardiac disorders\\nWhile less sensitive than echocardiography, chest x\\nray can be used to check for disorders such as congestive\\nheart failureor pulmonary edema.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n747\\nChest x ray\\nA normal chest x ray of a child.

Because the procedure involves radia-\\ntion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure,\\nparticularly for children. However, the amount of radia-\\ntion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal.\\nDescription\\nRoutine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal\\nview (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat-\\neral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for\\nthis exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid\\nin the lungs.\\nDuring the actual time of exposure, the technologist\\nwill ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very\\nimportant in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no\\nmotion that could detract from the quality and sharpness\\nof the film image. The procedure will only take a few\\nminutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a\\nmatter of a few seconds.\\nThe chest x ray may be performed in a physician’s\\noffice or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or\\nhospital radiology department. In some cases, particular-\\nly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be\\ntaken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality\\nthan those taken with permanent equipment, but are the\\nbest choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden\\npatients may be placed in as upright a position as possi-\\nble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no advance preparation necessary for chest\\nx rays.

It produces an itchy, blistery rash that\\ntypically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa-\\nnied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of\\nchickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity\\nagainst the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken-\\npox are easily recognized and in most cases merely\\nunpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost\\nalways be carried out at home. Severe complications can\\ndevelop, however, and professional medical attention is\\nessential in some circumstances.\\nDescription\\nBefore the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released\\nfor use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children\\nborn each year in the United States contracted chicken-\\npox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000\\ncases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari-\\ncella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family),\\nwhich is spread through the air or by direct contact with\\nan infected person. Once someone has been infected with\\nthe virus, an incubation period of about 10–21 days pass-\\nes before symptoms begin. The period during which\\ninfected people are able to spread the disease is believed\\nto start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to\\ncontinue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which\\nusually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749\\nChickenpox'),\n",

For this\\nreason, doctors recommend keeping children with chick-\\nenpox away from school for about a week. It is not nec-\\nessary, however, to wait until all the scabs have fallen off.\\nChickenpox has been a typical part of growing up for\\nmost children in the industrialized world (although this\\nmay change if the new varicella vaccine becomes more\\nwidely accepted). The disease can strike at any age, but\\nby ages nine or 10 about 80–90% of American children\\nhave already been infected. U.S. children living in rural\\nareas and many foreign-born children are less likely to be\\nimmune. Because almost every case of chickenpox, no\\nmatter how mild, leads to lifelong protection against fur-\\nther attacks, adults account for less than 5% of all cases in\\nthe United States. Study results reported by the Centers\\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that\\nmore than 90% of American adults are immune to the\\nchickenpox virus. Adults, however, are much more likely\\nthan children to suffer dangerous complications. More\\nthan half of all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA case of chickenpox usually starts without warning\\nor with only a mild fever and a slight feeling of unwellness.\\nWithin a few hours or days small red spots begin to appear\\non the scalp, neck, or upper half of the trunk. After a further\\n12–24 hours the spots typically become itchy, fluid-filled\\nbumps called vesicles, which continue to appear in crops\\nfor the next two to five days. In any area of skin, lesions of\\na variety of stages can be seen. These blisters can spread to\\ncover much of the skin, and in some cases may also be\\nfound inside the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rectum.\\nSome people develop only a few blisters, but in most cases\\nthe number reaches 250–500. The blisters soon begin to\\nform scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not occur\\nunless the blisters have been scratched and become infect-\\ned. Occasionally a minor and temporary darkening of the\\nskin (called hyperpigmentation) is noticed around some\\nof the blisters. The degree of itchiness can range from bare-\\nly noticeable to extreme. Some chickenpox sufferers also\\nhave headaches, abdominal pain, or a fever. Full recovery\\nusually takes five to 10 days after the first symptoms\\nappear. Again, the most severe cases of the disease tend to\\nbe found among older children and adults.\\nAlthough for most people chickenpox is no more\\nthan a matter of a few days’ discomfort, some groups are\\nat risk for developing complications, the most common\\nof which are bacterial infections of the blisters,pneumo-\\nnia, dehydration, encephalitis, and hepatitis:\\n• Infants. Complications occur much more often among\\nchildren less than one year old than among older chil-\\ndren. The threat is greatest to newborns, who are more\\nat risk of death from chickenpox than any other group.\\nUnder certain circumstances, children born to mothers\\nwho contract chickenpox just prior to delivery face an\\nincreased possibility of dangerous consequences,\\nincluding brain damage and death. If the infection\\noccurs during early pregnancy , there is a small (less\\nthan 5%) risk of congenital abnormalities.\\n• Immunocompromised children. Children whose\\nimmune systems have been weakened by a genetic dis-\\norder, disease, or medical treatment usually experience\\nthe most severe symptoms of any group. They have the\\nsecond-highest rate of death from chickenpox.\\n• Adults and children 15 and older. Among this group,\\nthe typical symptoms of chickenpox tend to strike with\\ngreater force, and the risk of complications is much\\nhigher than among young children.\\nImmediate medical help should always be sought\\nwhen anyone in these high-risk groups contracts the dis-\\nease.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhere children are concerned, especially those with\\nrecent exposure to the disease, diagnosis can usually be\\nmade at home, by a school nurse, or by a doctor over the\\ntelephone if the child’s parent or caregiver is unsure that\\nthe disease is chickenpox.\\nA doctor should be called immediately if:\\n• The child’s fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or takes\\nmore than four days to disappear.\\n• The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection\\ninclude leakage of pus from the blisters or excessive\\nredness, warmth, tenderness, or swelling around the\\nblisters.\\n• The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or\\nunusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severe\\nheadache; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble\\nwalking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is having\\nbreathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complaining\\nof chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having con-\\nvulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome or\\nencephalitis, two rare but potentially very dangerous\\nconditions.\\nTreatment\\nWith children, treatment usually takes place in the\\nhome and focuses on reducing discomfort and fever.\\nBecause chickenpox is a viral disease,antibiotics are\\nineffective against it.\\nApplying wet compresses or bathing the child in cool\\nor lukewarm water once a day can help the itch.

Other recom-\\nmended remedies for itching include applying aloe vera,\\nwitch hazel, or herbal preparations of rosemary (Rosmar-\\ninus officinalis) and calendula ( Calendual officinalis ) to\\nthe blisters. Homeopathic remedies are selected on a case\\nby case basis. Some common remedy choices are tartar\\nemetic (antimonium tartaricum), windflower (pulsatilla),\\npoison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), and sulphur.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cases of chickenpox run their course within a\\nweek without causing lasting harm. However, there is\\none long-term consequence of chickenpox that strikes\\nabout 20% of the population, particularly people 50 and\\nolder. Like all herpes viruses, the varicella-zoster virus\\nnever leaves the body after an episode of chickenpox, but\\nlies dormant in the nerve cells, where it may be reactivat-\\ned years later by disease or age-related weakening of the\\nimmune system. The result is shingles (also called her-\\npes zoster), a very painful nerve inflammation, accompa-\\nnied by a rash, that usually affects the trunk or the face\\nfor 10 days or more. Especially in the elderly, pain,\\ncalled postherpetic neuralgia , may persist at the site of\\nthe shingles for months or years. As of 1998, two newer\\ndrugs for treatment of shingles are available. Both vala-\\ncyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir) stop the\\nreplication of herpes zoster when administered within 72\\nhours of appearance of the rash.

(12 December 1997).\\nBeth Kapes\\nChild abuse\\nDefinition\\nChild abuse is the blanket term for four types of\\nchild mistreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-\\ntional abuse, and neglect. In many cases children are the\\nvictims of more than one type of abuse. The abusers can\\nbe parents or other family members, caretakers such as\\nteachers and babysitters, acquaintances (including other\\nchildren), and (in rare instances) strangers.\\nDescription\\nPrevalence of abuse\\nChild abuse was once viewed as a minor social prob-\\nlem affecting only a handful of United States children.\\nHowever, in recent years it has received close attention from\\nthe media, law enforcement, and the helping professions,\\nand with increased public and professional awareness has\\ncome a sharp rise in the number of reported cases. But\\nbecause abuse is often hidden from view and its victims too\\nyoung or fearful to speak out, experts suggest that its true\\nprevalence is possibly much greater than the official data\\nindicate. In 1996, more than three million victims of alleged\\nabuse were reported to child protective services (CPS) agen-\\ncies in the United States, and the reports were substantiated\\nin more than one million cases. Put another way, 1.5% of\\nthe country’s children were confirmed victims of abuse in\\n1996. Parents were the abusers in 77% of the confirmed\\ncases, other relatives in 11%. Sexual abuse was more likely\\nto be committed by males, whereas females were responsi-\\nble for the majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 Unit-\\ned States children died from abuse in 1996.\\nAlthough experts are quick to point out that abuse\\noccurs among all social, ethnic, and income groups,\\nreported cases usually involve poor families with little\\neducation. Young mothers, single-parent families, and\\nparental alcohol or drug abuse are also common in report-\\ned cases. Charles F. Johnson remarks, “More than 90% of\\nabusing parents have neither psychotic nor criminal per-\\nsonalities. Rather they tend to be lonely, unhappy, angry,\\nyoung, and single parents who do not plan their pregnan-\\ncies, have little or no knowledge of child development, and\\nhave unrealistic expectations for child behavior.” About\\n10%, or perhaps as many as 40%, of abusive parents were\\nthemselves physically abused as children, but most abused\\nchildren do not grow up to be abusive parents.\\nTypes of abuse\\nPHYSICAL ABUSE.Physical abuse is the nonacciden-\\ntal infliction of physical injury to a child.

In 1996, 24% of the confirmed cases of\\nUnited Stateschild abuse involved physical abuse.\\nA rare form of physical abuse is Munchausen syn-\\ndrome by proxy, in which a caretaker (most often the\\nmother) seeks attention by making the child sick or\\nappear to be sick.\\nSEXUAL ABUSE. Charles F. Johnson defines child\\nsexual abuse as “any activity with a child, before the age\\nof legal consent, that is for the sexual gratification of an\\nadult or a significantly older child.” It includes, among\\nother things, sexual touching and penetration, persuading\\na child to expose his or her sexual organs, and allowing a\\nchild to view pornography. In most cases the child is\\nrelated to or knows the abuser, and about one in five\\nabusers are themselves underage. Sexual abuse was pre-\\nsent in 12% of the confirmed 1996 abuse cases. An esti-\\nmated 20–25% of females and 10–15% of males report\\nthat they were sexually abused by age 18.\\nEMOTIONAL ABUSE. Emotional abuse, according to\\nRichard D. Krugman, “has been defined as the rejection,\\nignoring, criticizing,isolation, or terrorizing of children,\\nall of which have the effect of eroding their self-esteem.”\\nEmotional abuse usually expresses itself in verbal attacks\\ninvolving rejection, scapegoating, belittlement, and so\\nforth. Because it often accompanies other types of abuse\\nand is difficult to prove, it is rarely reported, and\\naccounted for only 6% of the confirmed 1996 cases.\\nNEGLECT. Neglect—failure to satisfy a child’s basic\\nneeds—can assume many forms. Physical neglect is the\\nfailure (beyond the constraints imposed by poverty) to\\nprovide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision.\\nEmotional neglect is the failure to satisfy a child’s nor-\\nmal emotional needs, or behavior that damages a child’s\\nnormal emotional and psychological development (such\\nas permitting drug abuse in the home). Failing to see that\\na child receives proper schooling or medical care is also\\nconsidered neglect. In 1996 neglect was the finding in\\n52% of the confirmed abuse cases.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPhysical abuse\\nThe usual physical abuse scenario involves a parent\\nwho loses control and lashes out at a child. The trigger\\nmay be normal child behavior such as crying or dirtying\\na diaper. Unlike nonabusive parents, who may become\\nangry at or upset with their children from time to time\\nbut are genuinely loving, abusive parents tend to harbor\\ndeep-rooted negative feelings toward their children.\\nUnexplained or suspicious bruises or other marks\\non the skin are typical signs of physical abuse, as are\\nburns . Skull and other bone fractures are often seen\\nin young abused children, and in fact, head injuries are\\nthe leading cause of death from abuse. Children less\\nthan one year old are particularly vulnerable to injury\\nfrom shaking. This is called shaken baby syndrome\\nor shaken impact syndrome. Not surprisingly, physical\\nabuse also causes a wide variety of behavioral changes\\nin children.\\nSexual abuse\\nJohn M. Leventhal observes, “The two prerequisites\\nfor this form of maltreatment include sexual arousal to\\nchildren and the willingness to act on this arousal. Fac-\\ntors that may contribute to this willingness include alco-\\nhol or drug abuse, poor impulse control, and a belief that\\nthe sexual behaviors are acceptable and not harmful to\\nthe child.” The chances of abuse are higher if the child is\\ndevelopmentally handicapped or vulnerable in some\\nother way.\\nGenital or anal injuries or abnormalities (including\\nthe presence of sexually transmitted diseases ) can be\\nsigns of sexual abuse, but often there is no physical evi-\\ndence for a doctor to find. In fact, physical examinations\\nof children in cases of suspected sexual abuse supply\\ngrounds for further suspicion only 15–20% of the time.\\nAnxiety, poor academic performance, and suicidal con-\\nduct are some of the behavioral signs of sexual abuse, but\\nare also found in children suffering other kinds of stress.\\nExcessive masturbation and other unusually sexualized\\nkinds of behavior are more closely associated with sexu-\\nal abuse itself.\\nEmotional abuse\\nEmotional abuse can happen in many settings: at\\nhome, at school, on sports teams, and so on. Some of the\\npossible symptoms include loss of self-esteem, sleep dis-\\nturbances, headaches or stomachaches, school avoid-\\nance, and running away from home.\\nNeglect\\nMany cases of neglect occur because the parent\\nexperiences strong negative feelings toward the child.\\nAt other times, the parent may truly care about the\\nchild, but lack the ability or strength to adequately pro-\\nvide for the child’s needs because he or she is handi-\\ncapped by depression, drug abuse,mental retardation ,\\nor some other problem.\\nNeglected children often do not receive adequate\\nnourishment or emotional and mental stimulation. As a\\nresult, their physical, social, emotional, and mental\\ndevelopment is hindered. They may, for instance, be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n754\\nChild abuse'),\n",

The average length of labor is about 14\\nhours for a first pregnancy and about eight hours in sub-\\nsequent pregnancies. However, many women experience\\na much longer or shorter labor.\\nLabor can be described in terms of a series of phases.\\nFirst stage of labor\\nDuring the first phase of labor, the cervix dilates\\n(opens) from 0–10 cm. This phase has an early, or latent,\\nphase and an active phase. During the latent phase,\\nprogress is usually very slow. It may take quite a while\\nand many contractions before the cervix dilates the first\\nfew centimeters. Contractions increase in strength as\\nlabor progresses. Most women are relatively comfortable\\nduring the latent phase and walking around is encour-\\naged, since it naturally stimulates the process.\\nAs labor begins, the muscular wall of the uterus\\nbegins to contract as the cervix relaxes and expands. As a\\nportion of the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is pushed\\ninto the opening, it bursts under the pressure, releasing\\namniotic fluid. This is called “breaking the bag of waters.”\\nDuring a contraction, the infant experiences intense\\npressure that pushes it against the cervix, eventually forc-\\ning the cervix to stretch open. At the same time, the con-\\ntractions cause the cervix to thin. During this first stage, a\\nwoman’s contractions occur more and more often and last\\nlonger and longer. The doctor or nurse will do a periodic\\npelvic examto determine how the mother is progressing.\\nIf the contractions aren’t forceful enough to open the\\ncervix, a drug may be given to make the uterus contract.\\nAs pain and discomfort increase, women may be\\ntempted to request pain medication. If possible, though,\\nadministration of pain medication or anesthetics should\\nbe delayed until the active phase of labor begins—at\\nwhich point the medication will not act to slow down or\\nstop the labor.\\nThe active stage of labor is faster and more efficient\\nthan the latent phase. In this phase, contractions are\\nlonger and more regular, usually occurring about every\\ntwo minutes. These stronger contractions are also more\\npainful. Women who use the breathing exercises learned\\nin childbirth classes find that these can help cope with\\nthe pain experienced during this phase. Many women\\nalso receive some pain medication at this point—either a\\nshort-term medication, such as Nubain or Numorphan, or\\nan epidural anesthesia.\\nAs the cervix dilates to 8–9 cm, the phase called the\\ntransition begins. This refers to the transition from the\\nfirst phase (during which the cervix dilates from 0–10\\ncm) and the second phase (during which the baby is\\npushed out through the birth canal). As the baby’s head\\nbegins to descend, women begin to feel the urge to\\n“push” or bear down. Active pushing by the mother\\nshould not begin until the second phase, since pushing\\ntoo early can cause the cervix to swell or to tear and\\nbleed. The attending healthcare practitioner should coun-\\nsel the mother on when to begin to push.\\nSecond stage of labor\\nAs the mother enters the second stage of labor, her\\nbaby’s head appears at the top of the cervix. Uterine con-\\ntractions get stronger. The infant passes down the vagina,\\nhelped along by contractions of the abdominal muscles\\nand the mother’s pushing. Active pushing by the mother\\nis very important during this phase of labor. If an epidur-\\nal anesthetic is being used, many practitioners recom-\\nmend decreasing the amount administered during this\\nphase of labor so that the mother has better control over\\nher abdominal muscles.\\nWhen the top of the baby’s head appears at the open-\\ning of the vagina, the birth is nearing completion. First\\nthe head passes under the pubic bone. It fills the lower\\nvagina and stretches the perineum (the tissues between\\nthe vagina and the rectum). This position is called\\n“crowning,” since only the crown of the head is visible.\\nWhen the entire head is out, the shoulders follow. The\\nattending practitioner suctions the baby’s mouth and\\nnose to ease the baby’s first breath. The rest of the baby\\nusually slips out easily, and the umbilical cord is cut.\\nEpisiotomy\\nAs the baby’s head appears, the perineum may\\nstretch so tight that the baby’s progress is slowed down. If\\nthere is risk of tearing the mother’s skin, the doctor may\\nchoose to make a small incision into the perineum to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n757\\nChildbirth\\nPlacenta\\nUterus\\nUmbilical cord\\nVagina\\nCervix\\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix\\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix.(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)'),\n",

This is called an episiotomy.\\nIf the woman has not had an epidural or pudendal block,\\nshe will get a local anesthetic to numb the area. Once the\\nepisiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes.\\nThird stage\\nIn the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out\\nof the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The\\nplacenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam-\\neter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and has\\nserved to convey nourishment from the mother to the\\nfetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con-\\ntractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point.\\nIt is important that all of the placenta be removed from\\nthe uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal\\nafter delivery may be much heavier.\\nBreech presentation\\nApproximately 4% of babies are in what is called\\nthe “breech” position when labor begins. In breech pre-\\nsentation, the baby’s head is not the part pressing against\\nthe cervix. Instead the baby’s bottom or legs are posi-\\ntioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. An\\nobstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head down\\nposition using a technique called version. This is only\\nsuccessful approximately half the time.\\nThe risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation\\nare much higher than with a head-first presentation and the\\nmother and attending practitioner will need to weigh the\\nrisks and make a decision on whether to deliver via a\\ncesarean sectionor attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of\\nthe risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre-\\nsentation—of which there are three. Frank breech (the\\nbaby’s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com-\\nmon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types are\\ncomplete breech (in which the baby’s legs are crossed\\nunder and in front of the body) and footling breech (in\\nwhich one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth\\ncanal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery.\\nEven in complete breech, other factors should be\\nmet before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound\\nexamination should be done to be sure the baby does not\\nhave an unusually large head and that the head is tilted\\nforward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal\\nmonitoring and close observation of the progress of labor\\nare also important. A slowing of labor or any indication\\nof difficulty in the body passing through the pelvis\\nshould be an indication that it is safer to consider a\\ncesarean section.\\nForceps delivery\\nIf the labor is not progressing as it should or if the\\nbaby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a\\nforceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device that\\nresembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around the\\nbaby’s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out of\\nthe vagina.\\nForceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated,\\nand they might be required if:\\n• the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the\\nbaby into the birth canal\\n• the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal\\nunaided\\n• the baby shows signs of stress\\n• the mother is too exhausted to push\\nBefore placing the forceps around the baby’s head,\\npain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth-\\ner. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother’s\\nbladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapy\\nwater. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth,\\nalthough tears can still occur.\\nThe obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time\\ninto the vagina and around the side of the baby’s head to\\ngently grasp the head. When both “tongs” are in place, the\\ndoctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through the\\nbirth canal as the uterus contracts.

When used by an experienced\\nphysician, forceps can save the life of a baby in distress.\\nV acuum-assisted birth\\nThis method of helping a baby out of the birth canal\\nwas developed as a gentler alternative to forceps. Vacu-\\num-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix is\\nfully dilated (expanded), and the head of the fetus has\\nbegun to descend through the pelvis. In this procedure,\\nthe doctor uses a device called a vacuum extractor, plac-\\ning a large rubber or plastic cup against the baby’s head.\\nA pump creates suction that gently pulls on the cup to\\nease the baby down the birth canal. The force of the suc-\\ntion may cause a bruise on the baby’s head, but it fades\\naway in a day or so.\\nThe vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to\\ninjure the mother, and it leaves more room for the baby\\nto pass through the pelvis. However, there may be prob-\\nlems in maintaining the suction during the vacuum-\\nassisted birth, so forceps may be a better choice if it is\\nimportant to remove the baby quickly.\\nCesarean sections\\nA cesarean section, also called a c-section, is a surgi-\\ncal procedure in which incisions are made through a\\nwoman’s abdomen and uterus to deliver her baby.\\nCesarean sections are performed whenever abnor-\\nmal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery,\\nthreatening the life or health of the mother or the baby.\\nThe procedure is performed in the United States on near-\\nly one of every four babies delivered—more than\\n900,000 babies each year. The procedure is used in cases\\nwhere the mother has had a previous c-section and the\\narea of the incision has been weakened. Dystocia, or dif-\\nficult labor, is the another common reason for perform-\\ning a c-section.\\nDifficult labor is commonly caused by one of the\\nthree following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’s\\nbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus;\\nabnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequent\\ncontractions.\\nAnother major factor is fetal distress, a condition\\nwhere the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal brain\\ndamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-\\ntress is often related to abnormalities in the position of\\nthe fetus, or abnormalities in the birth canal, causing\\nreduced blood flow through the placenta.\\nOther conditions also can make c-section advisable,\\nsuch as vaginal herpes, hypertension (high blood pres-\\nsure) and diabetes in the mother.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOne of the first signs of approaching childbirth may\\nbe a “bloody show,” the appearance of a small amount of\\nblood-tinged mucus released from the cervix as it begins\\nto dilate. This is called the “mucus plug.”\\nThe most common sign of the onset of labor is con-\\ntractions. Sometimes women have trouble telling the dif-\\nference between true and false labor pains.\\nTrue labor pains:\\n• develop a regular pattern, with contractions coming\\ncloser together\\n• last from 15–30 seconds at the onset and get progres-\\nsively stronger and longer (up to 60 seconds)\\n• may get stronger with physical activity\\n• occur high up on the abdomen, radiating throughout the\\nabdomen and lower back\\nAnother sign that labor is beginning is the breaking\\nof the “bag of waters,” the amniotic sac which had cush-\\nioned the baby during the pregnancy. When it breaks, it\\nreleases water in a trickle or a gush. Only about 10% of\\nwomen actually experience this water flow in the begin-\\nning of labor, however. Most of the time, the rupture\\noccurs sometime later in labor. If the amniotic sac doesn’t\\nrupture on its own, the doctor will break it during labor.\\nSome women have diarrhea or nausea as labor\\nbegins. Others notice a sudden surge of energy and the\\nurge to clean or arrange things right before labor begins;\\nthis is known as “nesting.”\\nDiagnosis\\nThe onset of labor can be determined by measuring\\nhow much the cervix has dilated. The degree of dilation\\nis estimated by feeling the opening cervix during a pelvic\\nexam.

Contractions that cause the cervix to dilate are the\\nsign of true labor.\\nFetal monitoring\\nFetal monitoring is a process in which the baby’s\\nheart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during labor\\nand birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring.\\nA special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be\\nused. This is a simple and non-invasive method.\\nThe Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a\\nhandheld listening device that transmits the sounds of the\\nheart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece.\\nIt can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks after\\nconception. This method offers intermittent monitoring.\\nIt allows the mother freedom to move about and is also\\nuseful during contractions.\\nElectronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and\\nprovides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the\\nmother’s contractions. It can be used either continuously\\nor intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan-\\ncies, and is not often recommended for low risk ones\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmniotic sac —The membranous sac that sur-\\nrounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as\\npregnancy advances.\\nBreech birth—Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead\\nof the usual head first delivery. This can add to\\nlabor and delivery problems because the baby’s\\nbottom doesn’t mold a passage through the birth\\ncanal as well as does the head.\\nCervix—A small cylindrical organ about an inch\\nor so long and less than an inch around that makes\\nup the lower part and neck of the uterus. The\\ncervix separates the body and cavity of the uterus\\nfrom the vagina.\\nEmbryo—The unborn child during the first eight\\nweeks of its development following conception.\\nGestation—The period from conception to birth,\\nduring which the developing fetus is carried in the\\nuterus.\\nPerineum—The area between the thighs that lies\\nbehind the genital organs and in front of the anus.\\nPlacenta—The organ that develops in the uterus\\nduring pregnancy and that links the blood supplies\\nof mother and baby.\\nbecause it renders the mother immobile and requires\\ninterpretation.\\nInternal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more\\naccurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu-\\nous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires the\\nmother’s water to be broken and that she be two to three\\ncentimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only.\\nTelemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor-\\ning. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument\\non the mother’s thigh. The mother is able to remain\\nmobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used in\\nhigh-risk situations.\\nTreatment\\nMost women choose some type of pain relief during\\nchildbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs.\\nThe specific choice may depend on what’s available, the\\nwoman’s preferences, her doctor’s recommendations,\\nand how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have some\\nrisks and some advantages.\\nRegional anesthetics\\nRegional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals.\\nIn this technique, medication is injected into the space\\naround the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med-\\nications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig-\\nnals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensation\\nfrom the waist down. An epidural or spinal block can\\nprovide complete pain relief during cesarean birth.\\nAn epidural is placed with the woman lying on her\\nside or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allow\\nmore space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbed\\nwith antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in the\\nskin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between two\\nvertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of the\\nspinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con-\\ntinuous doses of anesthetic to be given.\\nThis type of anesthesia provides complete pain\\nrelief, and can help conserve a woman’s energy, since she\\ncan relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes-\\nthesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may be\\nharder for a woman to bear down when it comes time to\\npush, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjusted\\nas this stage nears.\\nSpinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as\\nepidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c-\\nsection delivery. It is administered in the same way as an\\nepidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amount\\nof anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected at\\none time. Because of the anesthetic’s effect on motor\\nnerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n760\\nChildbirth'),\n",

Overall, family involve-\\nment is receiving increased attention by the healthcare\\nsystems, and many hospitals now offer birthing rooms\\nand maternity centers to help the entire family. There are\\nseveral choices available for childbirth preparation.\\nLamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in\\nthe United States today. It was the first popular natural\\nchildbirth method, becoming popular in the 1960s.\\nBreathing exercises and concentration on a focal point\\nare practiced to allow mothers to control pain while\\nmaintaining consciousness. This allows the flow of oxy-\\ngen to the baby and to the muscles in the uterus to be\\nmaintained. A partner coaches the mother throughout the\\nbirthing process.\\nThe Read method, named for Dick Read, is a tech-\\nnique of breathing that was originated in the 1930s to\\nhelp mothers deal with apprehension and tension associ-\\nated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method uses\\ndifferent breathing for the different stages of childbirth.\\nThe LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery in a\\nquiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation of\\nthe baby and to foster mother-child bonding by placing\\nthe baby on the mother’s abdomen and having the mother\\nmassage him or her immediately after the birth. Then the\\nfather washes the baby in a warm bath.\\nThe Bradley method is called father-coached child-\\nbirth, because it focuses on the father serving as coach\\nthroughout the process. It encourages normal activities\\nduring the first stages of labor.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

He began med-\\nical school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred to\\nColumbia University’s College of Physicians and Sur-\\ngeons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting his\\nmedical studies that he would “work with children, who\\nhave their whole lives ahead of them” and so, upon tak-\\ning his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his general\\ninternship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, he\\nspecialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded with\\nchildren in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen area.\\nOn a summer vacation in 1943 he began to write his\\nmost famous book and he continued to work on it from\\n1944 to 1946 while serving as a medical officer in the\\nNavy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian tone\\nand rigorous instructions found in earlier generations of\\nbaby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on a\\nstrict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried.\\nSpock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psycho-\\nanalytic training with what mothers were telling him about\\ntheir children, told his readers “Y ou know more than you\\nthink you do. Don’t be afraid to trust your own common\\nsense. Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow the\\ndirections that your doctor gives you.” The response was\\noverwhelming.

When evaluating children, pediatricians\\nand child-care specialists assess related skill sets, such as\\na child’s acquisition and use of language, fine and gross\\nmotor skills, cognitive growth, and socialization, and\\nachievement of certain milestones in these areas. A\\ndevelopmental milestone is a task or skill set that a child\\nis expected to reach at a certain age or stage of life. For\\nexample, by age one, most children have achieved the\\nphysical milestone of walking with the assistance of an\\nadult. Developmental disorders may be identified and/or\\ndiagnosed by physicians, teachers, child psychologists,\\ntherapists, counselors, and other professionals who inter-\\nact with children on a regular basis.\\nIt is important to remember that all children are\\nunique, and develop at different paces within this broad\\nframework. Reaching a milestone early or late does not\\nnecessarily indicate a developmental problem. However,\\nif a child is consistently lagging on achieving milestones,\\nor has a significant deficit in one developmental area, he\\nor she may be experiencing developmental delays.\\nPediatricians and other medical professionals typi-\\ncally diagnose physical illness and disease in children. In\\ncases of illness and injury, children will undergo a thor-\\nough physical examination and patient history. Diag-\\nnostic tests may be performed as appropriate. In cases of\\nmental or emotional disorders, a psychologist or other\\nmental healthcare professional will meet with the patient\\nto conduct an interview and take a detailed social and\\nmedical history. Interviews with a parent or guardian\\nmay also be part of the diagnostic process. The physician\\nmay also administer one or more psychological tests\\n(also called clinical inventories, scales, or assessments).\\nTreatment\\nMedications may be prescribed to treat certain child-\\nhood illnesses. Proper dosage is particularly important\\nwith infants and children, as medications such as aceta-\\nminophen can be toxic in excessive amounts. Parents\\nand caregivers should always follow the instructions for\\nuse that accompany medications, and inform the child’s\\npediatrician if the child is taking any other drugs or vita-\\nmins to prevent potentially negative drug interactions.\\nAny side effects or adverse reactions to medication\\nshould be reported to the child’s physician.

However, as of early 2001,\\nthere was no known medical treatment or pharmacologi-\\ncal therapy that is capable of completely eliminating all\\nof the symptoms associated with pervasive developmen-\\ntal disorder (PDD), autism spectrum disorder, and mental\\nretardation. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and\\nbipolar disorder are also chronic, lifelong disorders,\\nalthough their symptoms can often be well-controlled\\nwith medication.\\nPrevention\\nParents can take some precautions to ensure the\\nsafety of their children. Childproofing the home, follow-\\ning a recommended immunization schedule, educating\\nkids on safety, learning CPR, and taking kids for regular\\nwell-child check-ups can help to protect against physical\\nharm. In addition, encouraging open communication\\nwith children can help them grow both emotionally and\\nsocially. Providing a loving and supportive home envi-\\nronment can help to nurture an emotionally healthy child\\nwho is independent, self-confident, socially skilled,\\ninsightful, and empathetic towards others.\\nBecause they are still developing motor skills, kids\\ncan be particularly accident prone. Observe the following\\nsafety rules to protect children from injury:\\n• Helmets and padding. Children should always wear a\\nproperly fitted helmet and appropriate protective gear\\nwhen riding a bike, scooter, or similar equipment or\\nparticipating in sports. They should also ride on desig-\\nnated bike paths whenever possible, and learn bicycle\\nsafety rules (i.e., ride with traffic, use hand signals).\\n• Playground safety. Swing sets and other outdoor play\\nequipment should be well-maintained have at least 12\\nin (30 cm) of loose fill materials (e.g., sand, wood\\nchips) underneath to cushion falls, and children should\\nalways be properly supervised at play.\\n• Stay apprised of recalls. Children’s toys, play equip-\\nment, and care products are frequently involved in\\nproduct recalls. The U.S. Consumer Safety Products\\nCommission (CSPC) is the agency responsible for\\ntracking these recalls (see Resources below).\\n• Stay safe in the car. Up to 85% of children’s car seats\\nare improperly installed and/or used. Infants should\\nalways be in a rear-facing car seat until they are over 12\\nmonths of age and weigh more than 20 lb (9 kg).

It is grounded in the principle that the body can\\nheal itself when the skeletal system is correctly aligned\\nand the nervous system is functioning properly. To\\nachieve this, the practitioner uses his or her hands or an\\nadjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of the\\nvertebrae. When these bones of the spine are not correct-\\nly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxa-\\ntion, the theory is that nerve transmission is disrupted\\nand causes pain and illness manifested in the back as\\nwell as other areas of the body.\\nChiropractic is one of the most popular alternative\\ntherapies currently available. Some would say it now\\nqualifies as mainstream treatment as opposed to comple-\\nmentary medicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered by\\nmany insurance plans. It has become well-accepted treat-\\nment for acute pain and problems of the spine, including\\nlower back pain and whiplash. Applications beyond that\\nscope are not supported by current evidence, although\\nthere are ongoing studies into the usefulness of chiroprac-\\ntic for such problems as ear infections,dysmenorrhea ,\\ninfant colic, migraine headaches, and other conditions.\\nPurpose\\nMost people will experience back pain at some time\\nin their lives. Injuries due to overexertion and poor pos-\\nture are among the most common. Depending on the\\ncause and severity of the condition, options for treatment\\nmay include physical therapy, rest, medications, surgery,\\nor chiropractic care. Chiropractic treatment carries none\\nof the risks of surgical or pharmacologic treatment. Prac-\\ntitioners use a holistic approach to health, which is\\nappreciated by most patients. The goal is not merely to\\nrelieve the present ailment, but to analyze the cause and\\nrecommend appropriate changes of lifestyle to prevent\\nthe problem from recurring again. They believe in a\\nrisk/benefit analysis before use of any intervention. The\\nodds of an adverse outcome are extremely low. Chiro-\\npractic has proven in several studies to be less expensive\\nthan many more traditional routes such as outpatient\\nphysical therapy. Relief from some neuromuscular prob-\\nlems is immediate, although a series of treatments is like-\\nly to be required to maintain the improvement. Spinal\\nmanipulation is an excellent option for acute lower back\\npain, and may also relieve neck pain as well as other\\nmusculoskeletal pain. Although most back pain will sub-\\nside eventually with no treatment at all, chiropractic\\ntreatment can significantly shorten the time it takes to get\\nrelief. Some types of headache can also be successfully\\ntreated by chiropractic.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nSpinal manipulation has a long history in many cul-\\ntures but Daniel D. Palmer is the founder of modern chi-\\nropractic theory, dating back to the 1890s. A grocer and\\nmagnetic healer, he applied his knowledge of the nervous\\nsystem and manual therapies in an unusual situation. One\\nrenowned story concerns Harvey Lillard, a janitor in the\\noffice where Palmer worked. The man had been deaf for\\n17 years, ever since he had sustained an injury to his\\nupper spine. Palmer performed an adjustment on a painful\\nvertebra in the region of the injury and Lillard’s hearing\\nwas reputedly restored. Palmer theorized that all commu-\\nnication from the brain to the rest of the body passes\\nthrough the spinal canal, and areas that are poorly aligned\\nor under stress can cause physical symptoms both in the\\nspine and in other areas of the body. Thus the body has\\nthe innate intelligence to heal itself when unencumbered\\nby spinal irregularities causing nerve interference. After\\nhis success with Lillard, other patients began coming to\\nhim for care, and responded well to adjustments. This\\nresulted in Palmer’s further study of the relationship\\nbetween an optimally functional spine and normal health.\\nPalmer founded the first chiropractic college in\\n1897. His son, B. J. Palmer, continued to develop chiro-\\npractic philosophy and practice after his father’s death.\\nB. J. and other faculty members were divided over the\\nrole of subluxation in disease. B. J. saw it as the cause of\\nall disease. The others disagreed and sought a more ratio-\\nnal way of thinking, thus broadening the base of chiro-\\npractic education. From 1910–1920, many other chiro-\\npractic colleges were established. Other innovators,\\nincluding John Howard, Carl Cleveland, Earl Home-\\nwood, Joseph Janse, Herbert Lee, and Claude Watkins,\\nalso helped to advance the profession.\\nThe theories of the Palmers receive somewhat\\nbroader interpretation today. Many chiropractors believe\\nthat back pain can be relieved and health restored\\nthrough chiropractic treatment even in patients who do\\nnot have demonstrable subluxations. Scientific develop-\\nment and research of chiropractic is gaining momentum.\\nThe twenty-first century will likely see the metaphysical\\nconcepts such as innate intelligence give way to more\\nscientific proofs and reform.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n767\\nChiropractic'),\n",

He was\\none of five siblings, the children of a shoemaker and his\\nwife, Thomas and Katherine Palmer. Daniel Palmer and\\nhis older brother fell victim to wanderlust and left Cana-\\nda with a tiny cash reserve in April 1865. They immi-\\ngrated to the United States on foot, walking for 30 days\\nbefore arriving in Buffalo, New York. They traveled by\\nboat through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Detroit, Michi-\\ngan. There they survived by working odd jobs and sleep-\\ning on the dock. Daniel Palmer settled in What Cheer,\\nIowa, where he supported himself and his first wife as a\\ngrocer and fish peddler in the early 1880s. He later\\nmoved to Davenport, Iowa, where he raised three\\ndaughters and one son.\\nPalmer was a man of high curiosity. He investigated\\na variety of disciplines of medical science during his\\nlifetime, many of which were in their infancy. He was\\nintrigued by phrenology and assorted spiritual cults, and\\nfor nine years he investigated the relationship between\\nmagnetism and disease. Palmer felt that there was one\\nthing that caused disease. He was intent upon discover-\\ning this one thing, or as he called it: the great secret.\\nIn September 1895, Palmer purported to have cured\\na deaf man by placing pressure on the man’s displaced\\nvertebra. Shortly afterward Palmer claimed to cure\\nanother patient of heart trouble, again by adjusting a dis-\\nplaced vertebra. The double coincidence led Palmer to\\ntheorize that human disease might be the result of dislo-\\ncated or luxated bones, as Palmer called them. That\\nsame year he established the Palmer School of Chiro-\\npractic where he taught a three-month course in the sim-\\nple fundamentals of medicine and spinal adjustment.\\nPalmer, who was married six times during his life,\\ndied in California in 1913; he was destitute.

The air sacs\\n(alveoli) and/or the tissues of the lungs become swollen,\\nand the alveoli may fill with pus or fluid. This prevents the\\nlungs from taking in sufficient oxygen, which deprives the\\nblood and the rest of the body’s tissues of oxygen.\\nThere are three major types of Chlamydia: Chlamy-\\ndia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia tra-\\nchomatis. Each of these has the potential to cause a type\\nof pneumonia.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChlamydia trachomatisis a major cause of sexually\\ntransmitted diseases (called nongonococcal urethritis\\nand pelvic inflammatory disease). When a woman with\\nan active chlamydial infection gives birth to a baby, the\\nbaby may aspirate (suck into his or her lungs) some of\\nthe mother’s bacteria-laden secretions while passing\\nthrough the birth canal. This can cause a form of relative-\\nly mild pneumonia in the newborn, occurring about two\\nto six weeks after delivery.\\nChlamydia psittaci is a bacteria carried by many\\ntypes of birds, including pigeons, canaries, parakeets, par-\\nrots, and some gulls. Humans acquire the bacteria through\\ncontact with dust from bird feathers, bird droppings, or\\nfrom the bite of a bird carrying the bacteria. People who\\nkeep birds as pets or who work where birds are kept have\\nthe highest risk for this type of pneumonia. This pneumo-\\nnia, called psittacosis, causes fever, cough, and the pro-\\nduction of sputum containing pus. This type of pneumo-\\nnia may be quite severe, and is usually more serious in\\nolder patients. The illness can last several weeks.\\nChlamydia pneumoniae usually causes a type of rel-\\natively mild “walking pneumonia.” Patients experience\\nfever and cough. This type of pneumonia is called a\\n“community-acquired pneumonia” because it is easily\\npassed from one member of the community to another.\\nDiagnosis\\nLaboratory tests indicating the presence of one of\\nthe strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive,\\nand performed in only a few laboratories across the\\ncountry. For this reason, doctors diagnose most cases of\\nchlamydial pneumonia by performing a physical exami-\\nnation of the patient, and noting the presence of certain\\nfactors. For instance, if the mother of a baby sick with\\npneumonia is positive for a sexually transmitted disease\\ncaused by Chlamydia trachomatis, the diagnosis is obvi-\\nous. History of exposure to birds in a patient sick with\\npneumonia suggests that Chlamydia psittaci may be the\\nculprit. A mild pneumonia in an otherwise healthy per-\\nson is likely to be a community-acquired walking pneu-\\nmonia, such as that caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment varies depending on the specific type of\\nChlamydia causing the infection. A newborn with\\nChlamydia trachomatis improves rapidly with ery-\\nthromycin. Chlamydia psittaci infection is treated with\\ntetracycline, bed rest, oxygen supplementation, and\\ncodeine-containing cough preparations. Chlamydia\\npneumoniae infection is treated with erythromycin.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis is generally excellent for the newborn\\nwith Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia. Chlamydia\\npsittaci may linger, and severe cases have a death rate of\\nas high as 30%. The elderly are hardest hit by this type of\\npneumonia.

When a person is\\nchoking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways cannot\\nbe cleared,death follows rapidly.\\nAnyone can choke, but choking is more common in\\nchildren than in adults. Choking is a common cause of\\naccidental death in young children who are apt to put toys\\nor coins in their mouths, then unintentionally inhale them.\\nAbout 3,000 adults die each year from choking on food.\\nPeople also choke because infection causes the\\nthroat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is what\\ncaused George Washington’s death. Allergic reactions\\ncan also cause the throat to swell shut. Acute allergic\\nreactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may be\\nfatal. Strangulation puts external pressure on the trachea\\ncausing another form of choking.\\nFinally, people can choke from obstructive sleep\\napnea. This is a condition where tissues of the body\\nobstruct the airways during sleep. Sleep apnea is most\\ncommon in obese men who sleep on their backs. Smok-\\ning, heavy alcohol use, lung diseases such as emphyse-\\nma, and an inherited tendency toward a narrowed airway\\nand throat all increase the risk of choking during sleep.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are three reasons why people choke. These are:\\n• mechanical obstruction\\n• tissue swelling\\n• crushing of the trachea\\nRegardless of the cause, choking cuts off the air sup-\\nply to the lungs. Indications that a person’s airway is\\nblocked include:\\n• the person cannot speak or cry out\\n• the person’s face turns blue from lack of oxygen\\n• the person desperately grabs at his or her throat\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2772\\nChoking'),\n",

In choking due to infection, the\\nperson, usually a child, will have a fever and signs of ill-\\nness before labored breathing begins. If choking is due to\\nan allergic reaction to medication or insect bites, the per-\\nson’s earlobes and face will swell, giving an external sign\\nthat internal swelling is also occurring.\\nChoking due to sleep apnea is usually diagnosed on\\nreports of symptoms by the person’s sleep partner. There\\nare also alarm devices to detect the occurrence of sleep\\napnea. Eventually sleep may be interrupted so frequently\\nthat daytime drowsiness becomes a problem.\\nTreatment\\nChoking, except during sleep apnea, is a medical\\nemergency. If choking is due to allergic reaction or infec-\\ntion, people should summon emergency help or go\\nimmediately to an emergency room. If choking is due to\\nobstructed airways, the Heimlich maneuver (an emer-\\ngency procedure in which a person is grasped from\\nbehind in order to forcefully expel the obstruction)\\nshould be performed immediately. In severe cases a tra-\\ncheotomy (an incision into the trachea through the neck\\nbelow the larynx) must be performed.\\nPatients who suffer airway obstruction during sleep\\ncan be treated with a device similar to an oxygen mask\\nthat creates positive airway pressure and delivers a mix-\\nture of oxygen and air.\\nPrognosis\\nMany people are treated successfully for choking\\nwith no permanent effects.

The term applies to inflammation of any portion of\\nthe bile ducts, which carry bile from the liver to the gall-\\nbladder and intestine. The inflammation is produced by\\nbacterial infection or sometimes other causes.\\nDescription\\nBile, which is needed for digestion, is produced in\\nthe liver and then enters the common bile duct (CBD)\\nthrough the hepatic ducts.

The increase in pressure eventually causes the\\nbile to flow into the gallbladder. During meals, the gall-\\nbladder contracts and the sphincter between the gallblad-\\nder and intestine relaxes, permitting bile to flow into the\\nintestine and take part in digestion.\\nBile that has just been produced by the liver is sterile\\n(free of bacteria). This is partly due to its antibacterial\\nproperties; these are produced by the immunoglobulins\\n(antibodies) secreted in bile, the bile acids which inhibit\\nbacterial growth themselves, and mucus.\\nA small number of bacteria may be present in the bile\\nducts and gallbladder, getting there by moving backward\\nfrom the intestine, which unlike the bile ducts, contains\\nlarge numbers of bacteria. The normal flow of bile out of\\nthe ducts and into the intestine also helps keep too many\\norganisms from multiplying. Bacteria also reach the bile\\nducts from the lymph tissue or from the blood stream.\\nWhen the passage of bile out of the ducts is blocked,\\nthe few bacteria that are there rapidly reproduce. A par-\\ntial blockage to the flow of bile can occur when a stone\\nfrom the gallbladder blocks the duct, and also allows\\nbacteria to flow back into the CBD, and creates ideal\\nconditions for their growth. Tumors, on the other hand,\\ncause a more complete blockage of bile flow, both in and\\nout, so fewer infections occur. The reproducing organ-\\nisms are often able to enter the bloodstream and infect\\nmultiple organs such as the liver and heart valves.\\nAnother source of inflammation of the bile ducts\\noccurs in diseases of altered immunity, known as “autoim-\\nmune diseases.” In these diseases, the body fails to recog-\\nnize certain cells as part of its normal composition. The\\nbody thinks these cells are foreign and produces antibod-\\nies to fight them off, just as it fights against bacteria and\\nviruses. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a typical exam-\\nple of an autoimmune disease involving the bile ducts.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs noted above, the two things that are needed for\\ncholangitis to occur are: 1) obstruction to bile flow, and\\n2) presence of bacteria within the bile ducts. The most\\ncommon cause of cholangitis is infection of the bile\\nducts due to blockage by a gallstone. Strictures (portions\\nof ducts that have become narrow) also function in the\\nsame way. Strictures may be due to congenital (birth)\\nabnormalities of the bile ducts, form as a result of injury\\nto the bile duct (such as surgery, trauma), or result from\\ninflammation that leads to scar tissue and narrowing.\\nThe bacterium most commonly associated with infec-\\ntion of the bile ducts is Escherichia coli (E. coli)which is a\\nnormal inhabitant of the intestine. In some cases, more\\nthan one type of bacteria is involved. Patients with AIDS\\ncan develop infection of narrowed bile ducts with unusual\\norganisms such as Cryptosporidiumand others.\\nThe three symptoms present in about 70% of patients\\nwith cholangitis are abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice.\\nSome patients only have chills and fever with minimal\\nabdominal symptoms. Jaundice or yellow discoloration of\\nthe skin and eyes occurs in about 80% of patients. The\\ncolor change is due to bile pigments that accumulate in the\\nblood and eventually in the skin and eyes.\\nInflammation due to the autoimmune disease prima-\\nry sclerosing cholangitis leads to multiple areas of nar-\\nrowing and eventual infection. Tumors can block the bile\\nduct and also cause cholangitis, but as noted, infection is\\nrelatively infrequent; in fact cholangitis occurs in only\\nabout one in six patients with tumors.\\nAnother type of bile duct infection occurs mainly in\\nSoutheast Asia and is known as recurrent pyogenic\\ncholangitis or Oriental cholangitis. It has also been iden-\\ntified in Asians immigrating to North America. Most\\npatients have stones in the bile ducts and/or gallbladder,\\nand many cases are associated with the presence of para-\\nsites within the ducts. The role of parasites in causing\\ninfection is not clear. Many researchers believe that they\\nare just coincidental, and have nothing to do with the\\nstones or infection.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe above symptoms alone are very suggestive of\\ncholangitis; however, it is important to determine the exact\\ncause and site of possible obstruction. This is because\\nattacks are likely to recur, and different causes require dif-\\nferent treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangi-\\ntis due to a stone in the CBD is different from that due to\\nbile duct strictures. An elevated white blood count sug-\\ngests infection, but may be normal in 20% of patients.\\nAbnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as biliru-\\nbin and others are also frequently present. The specific\\nbacteria is sometimes identified from blood cultures.\\nX-ray techniques\\nA number of x-ray techniques can make the diagno-\\nsis of bile duct obstruction; these include ultrasound and\\ncomputed tomography scans(CT scans). However,\\nultrasound often cannot tell if an obstruction is due to a\\nstricture or stone, missing a stone in about half the cases.\\nCT scans have an even poorer record of stone detection.\\nAnother method of diagnosing and sometimes treat-\\ning the cause of bile duct obstruction or narrowing is\\ncalled percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.

In eval-\\nuating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is often\\ninjected intravenously. The procedure is of greatest\\nvalue in diagnosing the complications of gallstones\\n(such as abscesses, pancreatitis) rather than docu-\\nmenting the presence of a stone.\\nEndoscope—An endoscope as used in the field of\\ngastroenterology is a thin flexible tube which uses a\\nlens or miniature camera to view various areas of\\nthe gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is\\nperformed to examine certain organs such as the\\nbile ducts or pancreas, the organs are not viewed\\ndirectly, but rather indirectly through the injection\\nof x-ray dye into the bile duct.\\nEndoscopy—The performance of an exam using an\\nendoscope is referred by the general term\\nendoscopy. Diagnosis through biopsies or other\\nmeans and therapeutic procedures can be done\\nwith these instruments.\\nExtracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)—This\\nis a technique that uses high-pressure waves similar\\nto sound waves that can be “focused” on a very small\\narea, thereby fracturing small solid objects such as\\ngallstones, kidney stones, etc. The small fragments\\ncan pass more easily and harmlessly into the intes-\\ntine or can be dissolved with medications.\\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis—A chronic disease\\nin which it is believed that the immune system fails\\nto recognize the cells that compose the bile ducts as\\npart of the same body, and attempts to destroy\\nthem. It is not clear what exactly causes the disease,\\nbut it is frequently associated with another inflam-\\nmatory disease of the digestive tract, ulcerative coli-\\ntis.

It is important to realize that even with\\nendoscopy, x-ray dye is injected into the ducts and there-\\nfore the radiologist plays a role in both types of proce-\\ndures. When endoscopy is used, the muscle between the\\nintestine and bile duct is widened, to allow stones to\\npass. This is called a sphincterotomy and is often enough\\nto relieve any obstruction and help clear infection. The\\nwidening of the muscle is needed if other procedures\\ninvolving the bile duct are going to be performed.\\nThe above techniques can be summarized as follows:\\n• Insertion of a catheter or thin flexible tube to drain bile\\nand relieve obstruction. When performed by insertion\\nof a needle into the liver the technique is called percuta-\\nneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD); when per-\\nformed endoscopically the catheter exits through the\\nnose and is called a nasobiliary drain.\\n• Balloons can be inserted into the ducts with either\\nmethod to dilate strictures.\\n• Insertion of a prosthesis which is a rigid or flexible tube\\ndesigned to keep a narrowed area open; it is usually\\nplaced after a stricture is dilated with a balloon.\\n• Removal of stones can be accomplished most often by\\nendoscopic techniques. A number of methods have\\nbeen developed to perform this including laser and con-\\ntact lithotripsy in which stones are fragmented by\\nhigh-energy waves.\\nSurgical treatment\\nFortunately, with recent advances in the above meth-\\nods, this is a last option. Nonetheless, about 5–10% of\\npatients will need to undergo surgical exploration of the\\nbile ducts.\\nIn some instances, the bile duct is so narrowed due to\\nprior inflammation or tumor, that it needs connection to a\\ndifferent area of the intestinal tract to drain. This is rather\\ncomplicated surgery and carries a mortality rate of 2%.\\nOther treatment\\nExtracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was\\nfirst used to break up kidney stones . The technique has\\nbeen extended to the treatment of gallstones, in both the\\ngallbladder and bile ducts. It is often combined with\\nendoscopic procedures to ease the passage of fragmented\\nstones, or oral medications that can dissolve the frag-\\nments. Rarely, stones are also dissolved by instilling vari-\\nous chemicals such as ether directly into the bile ducts.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outlook for those with cholangitis has markedly\\nimproved in the last several years due in large part to the\\ndevelopment of the techniques described above. For those\\npatients whose episode of infection is caused by some-\\nthing other than a simple stone, the future is not as bright,\\nbut still often responsive to treatment. Some patients with\\nautoimmune disease will need liver transplantation.\\nPrevention\\nThis involves eliminating those factors that increase\\nthe risk of infection of the bile ducts, mainly stones and\\nstrictures. If it is medically possible, patients who have\\ntheir gallbladder and suffer a bout of cholangitis should\\nundergo surgical removal of the gallbladder and removal\\nof any stones.\\nFor other patients, a variety of therapies as outlined\\nabove, including dissolving small stones with bile acids,\\nare also available. A combination of several of these\\nmethods is needed in some patients.

The two basic types of this procedure are\\nopen cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach. It\\nis estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currently\\nused for approximately 80% of cases.\\nPurpose\\nA cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia-\\nsis and cholecystitis . In cholelithiasis, gallstones of\\nvarying shapes and sizes form from the solid components\\nof bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall-\\nbladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciating\\nright upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul-\\nder. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec-\\ntion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upper\\nright abdominal pain,nausea and vomiting. This condi-\\ntion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removal\\nof the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the laparoscopic procedure requires general\\nanesthesia for about the same length of time as the open\\nprocedure,laparoscopy generally produces less postoper-\\native pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopic\\nprocedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall-\\nbladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe-\\nsions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present.\\nDescription\\nThe laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser-\\ntion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera on\\nthe end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in the\\nabdomen, which allows visualization of the internal\\norgans and projection of this image onto a video monitor.\\nThree smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru-\\nments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may be\\nused for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis-\\nsue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may be\\ncalled laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\\nIn a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall-\\nbladder is removed through a surgical incision high in the\\nright abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert-\\ned to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.\\nPreparation\\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure is\\nexplained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibited\\nafter midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be\\nordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting are\\npresent, a suction tube to empty the stomach may be\\nused, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainage\\ncatheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden-\\ntal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion of\\nthe trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument).\\nAftercare\\nPost-operative care for the patient who has had an open\\ncholecystectomy, as with those who have had any major\\nsurgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respi-\\nration and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow\\nbecause of the effect of anesthesia, and the patient’s reluc-\\ntance to breathe deeply due to the pain caused by the prox-\\nimity of the incision to the muscles used for respiration.

This\\npain may be relieved by laying on the left side with right\\nknee and thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also help\\nincrease the body’s reabsorption of the gas. The patient is\\nusually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed to\\nshower on the second postoperative day. The patient is\\nadvised to gradually resume normal activities over a three\\nday period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about 10 days.\\nRisks\\nPotential problems associated with open cholecys-\\ntectomy include respiratory problems related to location\\nof the incision, wound infection, or abscess formation.\\nPossible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy\\ninclude accidental puncture of the bowel or bladder and\\nuncontrolled bleeding.

Wright, RN\\nCholecystitis\\nDefinition\\nCholecystitis refers to a painful inflammation of the\\ngallbladder’s wall. The disorder can occur a single time\\n(acute), or can recur multiple times (chronic).\\nDescription\\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in the\\nupper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is connected\\nby a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to the liver, pan-\\ncreas, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine). To\\naid in digestion, the liver produces a substance called\\nbile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallblad-\\nder concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs some\\nof the fluid from the bile to make it more potent. After a\\nmeal, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder by strong\\nmuscular contractions, and passes through a duct into the\\nduodenum. Due to the chemical makeup of bile, the con-\\ntents of the duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level for\\ndigestion. The bile also plays an important part in allow-\\ning fats within the small intestine to be absorbed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn about 95% of all cases of cholecystitis, the gall-\\nbladder contains gallstones . Gallstones are solid accu-\\nmulations of the components of bile, particularly choles-\\nterol, bile pigments, and calcium. These solids may\\noccur when the components of bile are not in the correct\\nproportion to each other. If the bile becomes overly con-\\ncentrated, or if too much of one component is present,\\nstones may form. When these stones block the duct leav-\\ning the gallbladder, bile accumulates within the gallblad-\\nder. The gallbladder continues to contract, but the bile\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2778\\nCholecystitis'),\n",

The bilirubin is\\nreabsorbed into the bloodstream, and over time this biliru-\\nbin is deposited in the skin and in the whites of the eyes.\\nBecause bilirubin contains a yellowish color, it causes a\\nyellowish cast to the skin and eyes that is called jaundice.\\nGallstone formation is seen in twice as many women\\nas men, particularly those between the ages of 20 and 60.\\nPregnant women, or those on birth control pills or estro-\\ngen replacement therapy have a greater risk of gallstones,\\nas do Native Americans and Mexican Americans. People\\nwho are overweight, or who lose a large amount of\\nweight quickly are also at greater risk for developing\\ngallstones. Not all individuals with gallstones will go on\\nto have cholecystitis, since many people never have any\\nsymptoms from their gallstones and never know they\\nexist. However, the vast majority of people with chole-\\ncystitis will be found to have gallstones. Rare causes of\\ncholecystitis include severe burns or injury, massive sys-\\ntemic infection, severe illness, diabetes, obstruction by a\\ntumor of the duct leaving the gallbladder, and certain\\nuncommon infections of the gallbladder (including bac-\\nteria and worms).\\nAlthough there are rare reports of patients with\\nchronic cholecystitis who never experience any pain,\\nnearly 100% of the time cholecystitis will be diagnosed\\nafter a patient has experienced a bout of severe pain in\\nthe region of the gallbladder and liver. The pain may be\\ncrampy and episodic, or it may be constant. The pain is\\noften described as pushing through to the right upper\\nback and shoulder. Because deep breathing increases the\\npain, breathing becomes shallow. Fever is often present,\\nand nausea and vomiting are nearly universal. Jaundice\\noccurs when the duct leaving the liver is also obstructed,\\nalthough it may take a number of days for it to become\\napparent. When bacterial infection sets in, the patient\\nmay begin to experience higher fever and shaking chills.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of cholecystitis involves a careful abdomi-\\nnal examination. The enlarged, tender gallbladder may be\\nfelt through the abdominal wall. Pressure in the upper\\nright corner of the abdomen may cause the patient to stop\\nbreathing in, due to an increase in pain. This is called\\nMurphy’s sign. Physical examination may also reveal an\\nincreased heart rate and an increased rate of breathing.\\nBlood tests will show an increase in the white blood\\ncount, as well as an increase in bilirubin. Ultrasound is\\nused to look for gallstones and to measure the thickness\\nof the gallbladder wall (a marker of inflammation and\\nscarring). A scan of the liver and gallbladder, with careful\\nattention to the system of ducts throughout (called the bil-\\niary tree) is also used to demonstrate obstruction of ducts.\\nRare complications of cholecystitis include:\\n• massive infection of the gallbladder, in which the gall-\\nbladder becomes filled with pus (called empyema)\\n• perforation of the gallbladder, in which the build-up of\\nmaterial within the gallbladder becomes so great that\\nthe wall of the organ bursts, with a resulting abdominal\\ninfection called peritonitis\\n• formation of abnormal connections between the gall-\\nbladder and other organs (the duodenum, large intes-\\ntine, stomach), called fistulas\\n• obstruction of the intestine by a very large gallstone\\n(called gallstone ileus)\\n• emphysema of the gallbladder, in which certain bacte-\\nria that produce gas infect the gallbladder, resulting in\\nstretching of the gallbladder and disruption of its wall\\nby gas\\nTreatment\\nInitial treatment of cholecystitis usually requires\\nhospitalization. The patient is given fluids, salts, and sug-\\nars through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous or IV).\\nNo food or drink is given by mouth, and often a tube,\\ncalled a nasogastric or NG tube, will need to be passed\\nthrough the nose and down into the stomach to drain out\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n779\\nCholecystitis\\nA close-up view of an inflamed gallbladder.(Custom Medical\\nStock Photo.

Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking\\nwater contaminated with the bacteria. Although cholera\\nwas a public health problem in the United States and\\nEurope a hundred years ago, modern sanitation and the\\ntreatment of drinking water have virtually eliminated the\\ndisease in developed countries. In third world countries,\\nhowever, cholera is still common.\\nDescription\\nCholera is spread by eating food or drinking water\\nthat has been contaminated with cholera bacteria. Conta-\\nmination usually occurs when human feces from a per-\\nson who has the disease seeps into a community water\\nsupply. Fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated in\\nareas where crops are fertilized with human feces.\\nCholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water and\\ncan infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafood\\nobtained from such waters. Cholera is rarely transmitted\\ndirectly from one person to another.\\nCholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics. The\\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) estimates that during\\nany cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2–1% of the local\\npopulation will contract the disease. Anyone can get\\ncholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are more\\nlikely to die from the disease because they become dehy-\\ndrated faster than adults. There is no particular season in\\nwhich cholera is more likely to occur.\\nBecause of an extensive system of sewage and water\\ntreatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan,\\nand Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for visi-\\ntors and residents of these countries. People visiting or\\nliving in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indi-\\nan subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South Ameri-\\nca, should be aware of the potential for contracting\\ncholera and practice prevention. Fortunately, the disease\\nis both preventable and treatable.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause V . cholerae bacteria are sensitive to acid,\\nmost cholera-causing bacteria die in the acidic environ-\\nment of the stomach. However, when a person has ingest-\\ned food or water containing large amounts of cholera bac-\\nteria, some will survive to infect the intestines. As would\\nbe expected, antacid usage or the use of any medication\\nthat blocks acid production in the stomach would allow\\nmore bacteria to survive and cause infection.\\nIn the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte-\\nria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of water\\nand electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and then\\nto be abruptly eliminated as watery diarrhea. V omiting\\nmay also occur. Symptoms begin to appear between one\\nand three days after the contaminated food or water has\\nbeen ingested.\\nMost cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20\\npatients experience severe, potentially life-threatening\\nsymptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost through\\ndiarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour.\\nThis can produce a dangerous state of dehydration\\nunless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly replaced.\\nSigns of dehydration include intense thirst, little or no\\nurine output, dry skin and mouth, an absence of tears,\\nglassy or sunken eyes, muscle cramps, weakness, and\\nrapid heart rate. The soft spot on an infant’s head will\\nappear to be sunken or drawn in. Dehydration occurs most\\nrapidly in the very young and the very old because they\\nhave fewer fluid reserves. A doctor should be consulted\\nimmediately any time signs of severe dehydration occur.\\nImmediate replacement of the lost fluids and electrolytes\\nis necessary to prevent kidney failure,coma, and death.\\nDiagnosis\\nRapid diagnosis of cholera can be made by examin-\\ning a fresh stool sample under the microscope for the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n781\\nCholera\\nA false color transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of\\nVibrio cholerae bacterium magnified 6,000 times its original\\nsize.

In areas where cholera occurs often,\\nhowever, patients are usually treated for diarrhea and\\nvomiting symptoms as if they had cholera without labo-\\nratory confirmation.\\nTreatment\\nThe key to treating cholera lies in preventing dehy-\\ndration by replacing the fluids and electrolytes lost\\nthrough diarrhea and vomiting.

Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick, intact skin or\\nshell that is removed immediately before eating.\\n• Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or\\nceviche. Avoid salads and raw vegetables. Do not use\\nuntreated ice cubes in otherwise safe drinks.\\n• Stay out of it. Do not swim or fish in polluted water.\\nA cholera vaccine exists that can be given to travel-\\ners and residents of areas where cholera is known to be\\nactive, but the vaccine is not highly effective.

The term is taken from the Greek chole,\\nbile, and stasis, standing still.\\nDescription\\nCholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver\\n(intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). The\\nobstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin,\\nand fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood stream\\ninstead of being eliminated normally.\\nIntrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide-\\nspread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such as\\nhepatitis, that impair the body’s ability to eliminate bile.\\nExtrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect of\\nmany medications. It can also occur as a complication of\\nsurgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, or\\nintravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can be\\ncaused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that\\nblock the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the first\\npart of the small intestine (duodenum).\\nPregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts\\nto estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec-\\nond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition is\\nthe second most common cause of jaundice during preg-\\nnancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is\\nthe only symptom most women experience. Cholestasis\\nof pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usually\\ndisappear within two to four weeks after the baby’s birth\\nbut may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again.\\nA similar condition affects some women who take\\nbirth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the woman\\nstops using oral contraceptives. This condition does not\\nlead to chronic liver disease. A woman who develops\\ncholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy or\\nbirth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop-\\ning cholestasis from the other.\\nBenign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi-\\ntion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itching\\nand jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This condition\\ndoes not cause cirrhosis.\\nDrug-induced cholestasis may be a complication of\\nchemotherapy or other medications. The two major types\\nof drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury and\\nreactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions).\\nIn direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallels\\nthe amount of medication involved. This condition:\\n• develops a short time after treatment begins\\n• follows a predictable pattern\\n• usually causes liver damage\\nDirect toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients\\nwho take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer and\\nantinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at the\\nonset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responses\\nare varied and are not related to the amount of medica-\\ntion being taken.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIntrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati-\\ntis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem-\\nbling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, including\\nchlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma-\\ntion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s)\\nis stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronic\\nbiliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by\\ndestruction of small bile ducts) persists even after the\\nmedication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi-\\nlar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants\\n(amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo-\\nlidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), and\\nother drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be caused\\nby alcoholic liver disease,primary biliary cirrhosis ,\\ncancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part\\nof the body, and a number of rare disorders.\\nExtrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone\\nobstructing the passage through which bile travels from the\\ngallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by\\npancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a result\\nof non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures),\\nductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas.\\nCholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit-\\ntle, if any, inflammation.

It\\nis manufactured in the liver and carried throughout the\\nbody in the bloodstream. Problems can occur when too\\nmuch cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque on\\nblood vessel walls, which impedes blood flow to the\\nheart and other organs. The highest cholesterol content is\\nfound in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.\\nDescription\\nCholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of medi-\\ncine, since it has both a good side and bad side. It is nec-\\nessary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build cell\\nwalls, and participate in other processes for maintaining a\\nhealthy body. When people talk about cholesterol as a\\nmedical problem, they are usually referring to high cho-\\nlesterol. This can be somewhat misleading, since there are\\nfour components to cholesterol. These are:\\n• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol\\n• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol\\n• triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk for\\nheart disease\\n• total cholesterol\\nHigh LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major con-\\ntributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol forms\\nplaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which restricts or\\nblocks the supply of blood to the heart, and causes a\\ncondition called atherosclerosis . This can lead to a\\n“heart attack,” resulting in damage to the heart and pos-\\nsibly death . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) estimates that 90 million American adults,\\nroughly half the adult population, have elevated choles-\\nterol levels.\\nThe population as a whole is at some risk of devel-\\noping high LDL cholesterol in their lifetimes. Specific\\nrisk factors include a family history of high choles-\\nterol,obesity, heart attack or stroke, alcoholism , and\\nlack of regular exercise . The chances of developing\\nhigh cholesterol increase after the age of 45. One of the\\nprimary causes of high LDL cholesterol is too much fat\\nor sugar in the diet, a problem especially true in the\\nUnited States. Cholesterol is also produced naturally in\\nthe liver and overproduction may occur even in people\\nwho limit their intake of high cholesterol food. Low\\nHDL and high triglyceride levels are also risk factors\\nfor atherosclerosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are no readily apparent symptoms that indi-\\ncate high LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL. The only\\nway to diagnose the problems is through a simple blood\\ntest. However, one general indication of high cholesterol\\nis obesity. Another is a high-fat diet.\\nDiagnosis\\nHigh cholesterol is often diagnosed and treated by\\ngeneral practitioners or family practice physicians. In\\nsome cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinolo-\\ngist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and\\ntriglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to HDL ratio\\nare measured by a blood test called a lipid panel. The\\ncost of a lipid panel is generally $40–100 and is covered\\nby most health insurance and HMO plans, including\\nMedicare, providing there is an appropriate reason for\\nthe test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available over\\nthe counter but test only for total cholesterol. The results\\nshould only be used as a guide and if the total cholesterol\\nlevel is high or low, a lipid panel should be performed by\\na physician. In most adults the recommended levels,\\nmeasured by milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood,\\nare: total cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130;\\nHDL, more than 35; triglycerides, 30–200; and choles-\\nterol to HDL ratio, four to one. However, the recom-\\nmended cholesterol levels may vary, depending on other\\nrisk factors such as hypertension , a family history of\\nheart disease, diabetes, age, alcoholism, and smoking.\\nDoctors have always been puzzled by why some\\npeople develop heart disease while others with identical\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n786\\nCholesterol, high\\nTypes Of Cholesterol\\nTypes Levels\\nTotal cholesterol:\\nDesirable <200\\nBorderline 200 to 240\\nUndesirable >240\\nHDL cholesterol:\\nDesirable >45\\nBorderline 35 to 45\\nUndesirable <35\\nLDL cholesterol:\\nDesirable <130\\nBorderline 130 to 160\\nUndesirable >160\\nRatio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol:\\nDesirable <3\\nBorderline 3 to 4\\nUndesirable >4'),\n",

The\\nsmaller the particles, the greater the chance of develop-\\ning heart disease. It allows physicians to treat patients\\nwho have normal or close to normal results from a lipid\\npanel but abnormal particle size.\\nTreatment\\nA wide variety of prescription medicines are avail-\\nable to treat cholesterol problems.

The goal in\\npeople with higher risk factors for heart disease is less than\\n130 mg/dL.

The vegetarian low-cholesterol diet consists of at\\nleast six servings of whole grain foods, three or more\\nservings of green leafy vegetables, two to four servings\\nof fruit, two to four servings of legumes, and one or two\\nservings of non-fat dairy products daily.\\nA second diet is the Asian diet, with brown rice\\nbeing the staple. Other allowable foods include fish, veg-\\netables such as bok choy, bean sprouts, and black beans.\\nIt allows for one weekly serving of meat and very few\\ndairy products. The food is flavored with traditional\\nAsian spices and condiments, such as ginger, chilies,\\nturmeric, and soy sauce.\\nAnother regimen is the low glycemic or diabetic\\ndiet, which can raise the HDL (good cholesterol) level by\\nas much as 20% in three weeks.

However, two more recent studies have questioned\\nthe effectiveness of garlic in lowering “bad cholesterol.”\\nCholestin\\nCholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997 as\\na cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is a\\nprocessed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a tradi-\\ntional herbal remedy used for centuries by the Chinese.\\nTwo studies released in 1998 showed Cholestin lowered\\nLDL cholesterol by 20–30%. It also appeared to raise\\nHDL and lower triglyceride levels. Although the supple-\\nment contains hundreds of compounds, the major active\\nLDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical also\\nfound in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA banned\\nCholestin in early 1998 but a federal district court judge\\nlifted the ban a year later, ruling the product was a dietary\\nsupplement, not a drug. It is not fully understood how the\\nsubstance works and patients may want to consult with\\ntheir physician before taking Cholestin. No serious side\\neffects have been reported, but minor side effects, includ-\\ning bloating and heartburn, have been reported.\\nOther treatments\\nA study released in 1999 indicated that blue-green\\nalgae contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lower\\ncholesterol. The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon\\nflos-aquae (AFA) is available as an over-the-counter\\ndietary supplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid\\nor vitamin B3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by\\n10–20%, and raise HDL levels by 15–35%. It also can\\nreduce triglycerides. But because an extremely high dose\\nof niacin (2–3 g) is needed to treat cholesterol problems,\\nit should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision to\\nmonitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin can also cause\\nflushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with high\\nlevels of isoflavones also have been shown to reduce bad\\ncholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that contains 62\\nmg of isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, and\\ncan be incorporated into other diet regimens, including\\nvegetarian, Asian, and low glycemic.\\nPrognosis\\nHigh cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for\\nheart disease. Left untreated, too much bad cholesterol\\ncan clog the blood vessels, leading to chest pain\\n(angina), blood clots, and heart attacks. Heart disease is\\nthe number one killer of men and women in the United\\nStates. By reducing LDL, people with heart disease may\\nprevent further heart attacks and strokes, prolong and\\nimprove the quality of their lives, and slow or reverse\\ncholesterol build-up in the arteries. In people without\\nheart disease, lowering LDL can decrease the risk of a\\nfirst heart attack or stroke.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to prevent cholesterol problems is\\nthrough a combination of healthy lifestyle activities, a\\nprimarily low-fat and high-fiber diet, regular aerobic\\nexercise, not smoking, and maintaining an optimal\\nweight. But for people with high risk factors for heart\\ndisease, such as a family history of heart disease, dia-\\nbetes, and being over the age of 45, these measures\\nmay not be enough to prevent the onset of high choles-\\nterol.

On the good side, cholesterol plays impor-\\ntant roles in the structure of cells and in the production of\\nhormones. But too much cholesterol in the blood can lead\\nto heart and blood vessel disease. To complicate matters,\\nnot all cholesterol contributes to heart and blood vessel\\nproblems. One type, called high-density lipoprotein\\n(HDL) cholesterol, or “good cholesterol,” actually lowers\\nthe risk of these problems. The other type, low-density\\nlipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol,” is the\\ntype that threatens people’s health. The names reflect the\\nway cholesterol moves through the body. To travel\\nthrough the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself to\\na protein. The combination of a protein and a fatty sub-\\nstance like cholesterol is called a lipoprotein.\\nMany factors may contribute to the fact that some\\npeople have higher cholesterol levels than others. A diet\\nhigh in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical prob-\\nlems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an underactive\\nthyroid gland, an overactive pituitary gland, liver disease\\nor kidney failure also may cause high cholesterol levels.\\nAnd some people have inherited disorders that prevent\\ntheir bodies from properly using and eliminating fats.\\nThis allows cholesterol to build up in the blood.\\nTreatment for high cholesterol levels usually begins\\nwith changes in daily habits. By losing weight, stopping\\nsmoking, exercising more and reducing the amount of\\nfat and cholesterol in the diet, many people can bring\\ntheir cholesterol levels down to acceptable levels. How-\\never, some may need to use cholesterol-reducing drugs to\\nreduce their risk of health problems.\\nDescription\\nThere are four different classes of cholesterol lower-\\ning drugs:\\nBile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding\\nwith the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-\\ntion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blocking\\nthe digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent the\\nformation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:\\ncholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); and\\ncolesevalam (Welchol).\\nHMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are\\ndrugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-\\nglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of the\\nsteps in converting fat to cholesterol. These are the most\\neffective cholesterol lowering agents available. Drugs in\\nthis group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin\\n(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);\\npravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).\\nFibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-\\nS); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).\\nAlthough these drugs are less effective than the statins at\\nlowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower the\\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising\\nthe high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Their\\nexact mechanism of action is believed to be associated\\nwith inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.\\nNiacin, vitamin B-3, is also effective in lowering\\ncholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose of\\nniacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce choles-\\nterol levels is at least 500 mg each day. The mechanism\\nof action of niacin in cholesterol reduction is associated\\nwith the inhibition of VLDL secretion in the blood-\\nstream.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\ncholesterol-reducing drug used. The prescribing physi-\\ncian or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can\\nadvise about the correct dosage.\\nCholesterol-reducing drugs should be taken exactly\\nas directed and doses should not be missed. Double\\ndoses should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.\\nPhysicians may prescribe a combination of choles-\\nterol-reducing drugs, such as pravastatin and colestipol.\\nFollowing the directions for how and when to take the\\ndrugs is very important. The medicine may not work\\nproperly if both drugs are taken at the same time of day.\\nNiacin should not be taken at the same time as an\\nHMG-CoA inhibitor, as this combination may cause\\nsevere muscle problems. If niacin is taken in an over-the-\\ncounter form, both the prescribing physician and phar-\\nmacist should be informed. There are no problems when\\nthe niacin is taken in normal doses as a vitamin.\\nThe prescription should not be stopped without first\\nchecking with the physician who prescribed it. Choles-\\nterol levels may increase when the medicine is stopped,\\nand the physician may prescribe a special diet to make\\nthis less likely.\\nPrecautions\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking cholesterol-\\nreducing drugs is important.

Studies of laboratory animals have\\nshown that giving high doses of gemfibrozil during\\npregnancyincreases the risk of birth defects and other\\nproblems, including death of the unborn baby. The\\neffects of this drug have not been studied in pregnant\\nwomen. Women who are pregnant or who may become\\npregnant should check with their physicians before\\nusing gemfibrozil.\\nCholesterol-reducing drugs in the group known as\\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin, flu-\\nvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) should not be taken\\nby women who are pregnant or who plan to become\\npregnant soon. By blocking the production of choles-\\nterol, these drugs prevent a fetus from developing proper-\\nly. Women who are able to bear children should use an\\neffective birth control method while taking these drugs.\\nAny woman who becomes pregnant while taking these\\ndrugs should check with her physician immediately.\\nCholestyramine and colestipol will not directly harm\\nan unborn baby, because these drugs are not taken into\\nthe body. However, the drugs may keep the mother’s\\nbody from absorbing vitamins that she and the baby\\nneed. Pregnant women who take these drugs should ask\\ntheir physicians whether they need to take extra vitamins.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Because cholestyramine and cole-\\nstipol interfere with the absorption of vitamins, women\\nwho use these drugs while breastfeeding should ask their\\nphysicians if they need to take extra vitamins.\\nWomen who are breastfeeding should talk to their\\nphysicians before using gemfibrozil. Whether this drug\\npasses into breast milk is not known. But because animal\\nstudies suggest that it may increase the risk of some\\ntypes of cancer, women should carefully consider the\\nsafety of using it while breastfeeding.\\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin,\\npravastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin) should not be\\nused by women who are breastfeeding their babies.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Cholesterol-reduc-\\ning drugs may make some medical problems worse.\\nBefore using these drugs, people with any of these med-\\nical conditions should make sure their physicians are\\naware of their conditions:\\n• stomach problems, including stomach ulcer\\n•constipation\\n• hemorrhoids\\n•gallstones or gallbladder disease\\n• bleeding problems\\n• underactive thyroid\\n• heart or blood vessel disease\\nIn addition, people with kidney or liver disease may\\nbe more likely to have blood problems or other side\\neffects when they take certain cholesterol-reducing\\ndrugs. And some drugs of this type may actually raise\\ncholesterol levels in people with liver disease.\\nPatients with any of the following medical condi-\\ntions may develop problems that could lead to kidney\\nfailure if they take HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors:\\n• treatments to prevent rejection after an organ transplant\\n• recent major surgery\\n• seizures (convulsions) that are not well controlled\\nPeople with phenylketonuria (PKU) should be\\naware that sugar-free formulations of some cholesterol-\\nreducing drugs contain phenylalanine in aspartame.

Total\\nserum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken.\\nDoctors sometimes order a complete lipoprotein profile to\\nbetter evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary\\nartery disease, or CAD). The full lipoprotein profile also\\nincludes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemical\\ncompound that forms 95% of the fats and oils stored in ani-\\nmal or vegetable cells) and lipoproteins (high density and\\nlow density). Blood fats are also called “lipids.”\\nThe type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as\\nthe total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and can-\\nnot be dissolved in water. It must combine with a protein\\nmolecule called a lipoprotein in order to be transported in\\nthe blood. There are five major types of lipoproteins in the\\nhuman body; they differ in the amount of cholesterol that\\nthey carry in comparison to other fats and fatty acids, and\\nin their functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified,\\nas follows, according to their density:\\n• Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood\\nonly after a person has eaten foods containing fats.\\nThey contain about 7% cholesterol. Chylomicrons\\ntransport fats and cholesterol from the intestine into the\\nliver and then into the bloodstream. They are metabo-\\nlized in the process of carrying food energy to muscle\\nand fat cells.\\n• Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipopro-\\nteins carry mostly triglycerides, but they also contain\\n16–22% cholesterol. VLDLs are made in the liver and\\neventually become IDL particles after they have lost\\ntheir triglyceride content.\\n• Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). IDLs are\\nshort-lived lipoproteins containing about 30% choles-\\nterol that are converted in the liver to low-density\\nlipoproteins (LDLs).\\n• Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL molecules carry\\ncholesterol from the liver to other body tissues. They\\ncontain about 50% cholesterol. Extra LDLs are absorbed\\nby the liver and their cholesterol is excreted into the bile.\\nLDL particles are involved in the formation of plaques\\n(abnormal deposits of cholesterol) in the walls of the\\ncoronary arteries. LDL is known as “bad cholesterol.”\\n• High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL molecules are\\nmade in the intestines and the liver. HDLs are about\\n50% protein and 19% cholesterol. They help to remove\\ncholesterol from artery walls. Lifestyle changes,\\nincluding exercising, keeping weight within recom-\\nmended limits, and giving up smoking can increase the\\nbody’s levels of HDL cholesterol. HDL is known as\\n“good cholesterol.”\\nBecause of the difference in density and cholesterol\\ncontent of lipoproteins, two patients with the same total\\ncholesterol level can have very different lipid profiles\\nand different risk for CAD. The critical factor is the level\\nof HDL cholesterol in the blood serum. Some doctors\\nuse the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL choles-\\nterol when assessing the patient’s degree of risk. A low\\nTC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels\\nof cholesterol in the patient’s blood. The patient’s choles-\\nterol can also be fractionated (separated into different\\nportions) in order to determine the TC/HDL ratio. The\\nresults help the doctor to assess the patient’s risk for\\ncoronary artery disease (CAD). High LDL levels are\\nassociated with increased risk of CAD whereas high\\nHDL levels are associated with relatively lower risk.\\nIn addition, the results of the cholesterol test can\\nassist the doctor in evaluating the patient’s metabolism of\\nfat, or in diagnosing inflammation of the pancreas, liver\\ndisease, or disorders of the thyroid gland.\\nThe frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the\\npatient’s degree of risk for CAD. People with low choles-\\nterol levels may need to be tested once every five years.\\nPeople with high levels of blood cholesterol should be\\ntested more frequently, according to their doctor’s advice.\\nThe doctor may recommend a detailed evaluation of the\\ndifferent types of lipids in the patient’s blood. It is ideal to\\ncheck the HDL and triglycerides as well as the cholesterol\\nand LDL. In addition, the National Cholesterol Education\\nProgram (NCEP) suggests further evaluation if the patient\\nhas any of the symptoms of CAD or if she or he has two\\nor more of the following risk factors for CAD:\\n• male sex\\n• high blood pressure\\n• smoking\\n• diabetes\\n• low HDL levels\\n• family history of CAD before age 55\\nPrecautions\\nPatients who are seriously ill or hospitalized for\\nsurgery should not be given cholesterol tests because the\\nresults will not indicate the patient’s normal cholesterol\\nlevel.

Frey\\nCholinergic drugs\\nDefinition\\nCholinergic drugs are medications that produce the\\nsame effects as the parasympathetic nervous system.\\nPurpose\\nCholinergic drugs produce the same effects as acetyl-\\ncholine. Acetylcholine is the most common neurohor-\\nmone of the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of\\nthe peripheral nervous system responsible for the every\\nday work of the body. While the sympathetic nervous sys-\\ntem acts during times of excitation, the parasympathetic\\nsystem deals with everyday activities such as salivation,\\ndigestion, and muscle relaxation.\\nThe cholinergic drugs may be used in several ways.\\nThe cholinergic muscle stimulants are used to diagnose and\\ntreat myathenia gravis, a disease that causes severe muscle\\nweakness. This class of drugs includes ambenonium chlo-\\nride (Mytelase), edrophonium chloride (Tensilon), neostig-\\nmine (Prostigmine), and piridogstimina (Mestinón). These\\ndrugs are also widely used in surgery, both to reduce the\\nrisk of urinary retention, and to reverse the effects of the\\nmuscle relaxant drugs that are used in surgery.\\nCholinergic drugs are also used in control of glauco-\\nma, a disease that is caused by increased pressure inside\\nthe eye. The most common drugs used for this purpose\\nare demecarium (Humorsol) and echthiophate (Phospho-\\nline iodide).\\nDescription\\nCholinergic drugs usually act in one of two ways.\\nSome directly mimic the effect of acetylcholine, while\\nothers block the effects of acetylcholinesterase. Acetyl-\\ncholinesterase is an enzyme that destroys naturally\\noccurring acetylcholine. By blocking the enzyme, the\\nnaturally occurring acetylcholine has a longer action.\\nRecommended dosage\\nCholinergic drugs are available only by prescription.\\nThey may be available as eye drops, capsules, tablets, or\\ninjections.\\nPrecautions\\nCholinergic drugs should be avoided when the\\npatient has any sort of obstruction in the urinary or diges-\\ntive tracts, such a a tumor, or severe inflammation which\\nis causing blockage.\\nThey should be used with caution in patients with\\nasthma, epilepsy, slow heart beat, hyperthyroidism,o r\\ngastric ulcers.\\nThe effects of the cholinergic drugs are to produce\\nthe same effects as stimulation of the parasympathetic\\nnervous system.

It is associated with irritation or\\nwear on the underside of the kneecap, or patella. In a nor-\\nmal knee, the articular cartilage is smooth and elastic and\\nglides smoothly over the surface of the thighbone, or\\nfemur when the knee is bent. Erosion of the cartilage\\nroughens the surface and prevents this smooth action.\\nCMP is most common in adolescent females,\\nalthough older people may also develop it. An average of\\ntwo out of 10,000 people develop this condition, many of\\nthem runners or other athletes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCMP is the result of the normal aging process,\\noveruse, injury, or uneven pressures exerted on the knee\\njoint. In teens, CMP may be caused by uneven growth or\\nuneven strength in the thigh muscles. Growth spurts,\\ncommon in teens, may result in a mildly abnormal align-\\nment of the patella, which increases the angle formed by\\nthe thigh and the patellar tendon (Q-angle). This condi-\\ntion adds to the damage. Symptoms include pain, nor-\\nmally around the kneecap, and a grinding sensation felt\\nwhen extending the leg.

This prenatal testing procedure involves taking a\\nsample of the chorion frondosum—that part of the chori-\\nonic membrane containing the villi—for laboratory\\nanalysis. The chorionic membrane is the outer sac which\\nsurrounds the developing fetus. Chorionic villi are\\nmicroscopic, finger-like projections that emerge from the\\nchorionic membrane and eventually form the placenta.\\nThe cells that make up the chorionic villi are of fetal ori-\\ngin so laboratory analysis can identify any genetic, chro-\\nmosomal, or biochemical diseases of the fetus.\\nChorionic villus sampling is best performed\\nbetween 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure is\\nperformed either through the vagina and the cervix\\n(transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdomi-\\nnally) depending upon the preferences of the patient or\\nthe doctor. In some cases, the location of the placenta\\ndictates which method the doctor uses. Both methods are\\nequally safe and effective. Following the preparation\\ntime, both procedures take only about five minutes.\\nWomen undergoing chorionic villus sampling may expe-\\nrience no pain at all or feel cramping or pinching.

The cells are\\nstopped in the midst of cell division and spread onto a\\nmicroscope slide. Cells with clearly separated chromo-\\nsomes are photographed so that the type and number of\\nchromosomes can be analyzed. Chromosomes are strings\\nof DNA which have been tightly compressed. Humans\\nhave 23 pairs of chromosomes including the sex chromo-\\nsomes. Rearrangements of the chromosomes or the pres-\\nence of additional or fewer chromosomes can be identified\\nby examination of the photograph. Down syndrome, for\\ninstance, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. In\\naddition to the chromosomal analysis, specialized tests can\\nbe performed as needed to look for specific diseases such\\nas Tay-Sachs disease. Depending upon which tests are\\nperformed, results may be available as early as two days or\\nup to eight days after the procedure.\\nChorionic villus sampling costs between $1,200 and\\n$1,800. Insurance coverage for this test may vary.\\nAlternate procedures\\nThere are alternate procedures for diagnosing genet-\\nic and chromosomal disorders of the fetus. Amniocente-\\nsis is commonly used and involves inserting a needle\\nthrough the pregnant woman’s abdomen to obtain a sam-\\nple of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is usually per-\\nformed in the second trimester at approximately 16\\nweeks gestation and the laboratory analysis may take two\\nto three weeks. The two advantages of chorionic villus\\nsampling are that it is performed during the first trimester\\nand the results are available in about one week. However,\\nas of 1997, amniocentesis is being performed in the first\\ntrimester, but this is still very rare. The risk of miscar-\\nriage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women\\nout of 200) which is lower than that for chorionic villus\\nsampling (1–3%).\\nA noninvasive alternative is the maternal blood test\\ncalled triple marker screening or multiple marker screen-\\ning. A sample of the pregnant woman’s blood is analyzed\\nfor three different markers: alphafetoprotein (AFP),\\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol.\\nThe levels of these three markers in the mother’s blood\\ncan identify unborn babies who are at risk for certain\\ngenetic or chromosomal defects. This is a screening test\\nwhich determines the chance that the fetus has the defect,\\nbut it can not diagnose defects. A negative test result\\ndoes not necessarily mean the unborn baby does not have\\na birth defect. For instance, this screening test can only\\npredict 60–70% of the fetuses with Down syndrome.\\nPregnant women who have a positive triple marker\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n800\\nChorionic villus sampling'),\n",

CFS has so many names because\\nresearchers have been unable to find out exactly what\\ncauses it and because there are many similar, overlapping\\nconditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called\\nneurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi-\\nlar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because\\none of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain.\\nBecause of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and\\nCFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes.\\nIn the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of\\nCFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that\\nmany people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the\\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in\\ntheir blood. For a while they thought they had found the\\nculprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had\\nhigh EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels\\nof other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS.\\nThese findings have led many scientists to believe that a\\nvirus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS.\\nCFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because\\nit seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession-\\nals. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age,\\nrace, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get\\nCFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25–45 years\\nold, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of\\nhow many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the\\nsimilarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif-\\nficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo-\\nple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According\\nto the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the\\nUnited States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This\\nprobably is a low estimate since these figures do not\\ninclude children and are based on the CDC definition of\\nCFS, which is very strict for research purposes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere is no single known cause for CFS. Studies\\nhave pointed to several different conditions that might be\\nresponsible. These include:\\n• viral infections\\n• chemical toxins\\n•allergies\\n• immune abnormalities\\n• psychological disorders\\nAlthough the cause is still controversial, many doc-\\ntors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a\\nsingle illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of\\nsymptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is\\nthat a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical\\ninjures the body and damages the immune system, allow-\\ning dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all\\npeople have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not\\nactively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since\\nchildhood. When these viruses start growing again, the\\nimmune system may overreact and produce chemicals\\ncalled cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms.\\nImmune abnormalities have been found in studies of\\npeople with CFS, although the same abnormalities are\\nalso found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis-\\neases,cancer, and other disorders.\\nThe role of psychological problems in CFS is very\\ncontroversial. Because many people with CFS are diag-\\nnosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders,\\nsome experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are\\npsychological. However, many people with CFS did not\\nhave psychological disorders before getting the illness.\\nMany doctors think that patients become depressed or\\nanxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their\\nCFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the\\nresult of CFS and was not its cause.\\nHaving CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo-\\nple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from\\nperforming their normal daily activities. They find it dif-\\nficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to\\ntake part in social activities. They may have sleep distur-\\nbances that keep them from getting enough rest or they\\nmay sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as\\ntired after a full night’s sleep as before they went to bed.\\nWhen they exercise or try to be active in spite of their\\nfatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients\\ncall “payback”—debilitating exhaustion that can confine\\nthem to bed for days.\\nOther symptoms of CFS include:\\n• muscle pain (myalgia)\\n• joint pain (arthralgia)\\n• sore throat\\n• headache\\n•fever and chills\\n• tender lymph nodes\\n• trouble concentrating\\n• memory loss\\nA recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an\\nabnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23\\npatients with CFS.

In the\\nUnited States, many doctors use the CDC case definition\\nto determine if a patient has CFS.\\nTo be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both\\nof the following criteria:\\n• Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for\\nat least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not\\nthe result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly\\nrelieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational,\\nsocial, or personal activities to be greatly reduced.\\n• Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short-\\nterm memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender\\nlymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without\\nswelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or\\nseverity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise\\n(a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following\\nexercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more\\nthan 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or\\nrecurred during six or more consecutive months of illness\\nand must not have started before the fatigue began.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are\\navailable to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual-\\nly are individualized to each person’s particular symp-\\ntoms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom-\\nmend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced\\ndiet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and\\nresting when needed are key to maintaining existing\\nenergy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to\\nkeep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too\\nmuch exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp-\\ntoms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also\\nmay help some people with CFS.\\nMany medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal\\npreparations have been used to treat CFS. While many of\\nthese are unproven, others seem to provide some people\\nwith relief.

Females have two copies of\\nthe X chromosome, whereas males have one X and\\none Y . CGD also is a recessive defect meaning that\\nboth copies of the chromosome must have the defect\\nbefore it can be expressed. Females who have one X\\nchromosome without the defect do not get this dis-\\nease. Males, since they only have one X chromosome,\\nget the disease if the defect is present. Thus, CGD\\naffects mostly males.\\nCGD is an immunodeficiency disorder. Patients\\nwith immunodeficiency disorders suffer frequent infec-\\ntions. This happens because part of their immune system\\nisn’t working properly and the infectious microorgan-\\nisms are not killed as rapidly as is normal. In CGD there\\nis a defect in the ability of the white blood cells to kill\\nbacteria and fungi. The white blood cells affected are\\nphagocytic cells. They are part of the non-specific\\nimmune system and move via the blood to all parts of the\\nbody where they ingest and destroy microbes. Phagocyt-\\nic cells are the first line of defense against microorgan-\\nisms. In this disease, the decreased ability to kill\\nmicrobes that they have ingested leads to a failure to\\neffectively combat infectious diseases. Patients with\\nCGD are subject to certain types of recurring infection,\\nespecially those of the skin, lungs, mouth, nose,\\nintestines, and lymph nodes. With the exception of the\\nlymph nodes, all of these areas are considered external\\ntissues that come into contact with microorganisms from\\nthe environment. The lymph system drains all areas of\\nthe body to eliminate destroyed microorganisms and to\\nassist the immune system in attacking microorganisms.\\nInfections occur in the lymph nodes as a consequence of\\nthe normal draining function.\\nKEY TERMS\\nImmunodeficiency —A weakening of the body’s\\nimmune system.\\nPhagocytic cells—A cell that ingests microorgan-\\nisms and foreign particles.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect that causes CGD reduces the\\namount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that white\\nblood cells can make. These chemicals are important for\\nkilling bacteria and fungi. Without them the white blood\\ncells ingest the microorganisms, but can’t kill them. In\\nsome cases, the microbes then replicate inside the white\\nblood cell eventually causing its death.\\nSymptoms of the disease usually appear by age two.\\nFrequent, recurrent infections of the skin, lungs (e.g.\\npneumonia), mouth (e.g. gingivitis), nose, intestines and\\nlymph nodes are a hallmark of this disease. Patients may\\nalso develop multiple, recurrent liver abscesses and bone\\ninfections (osteomyelitis).\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on the observation of a pat-\\ntern of recurrent infections. Blood tests of lymphocyte\\nand antibody functions will be normal. Tests of phago-\\ncytic cells will show normal ingestion, but a greatly\\ndecreased ability to kill bacteria.\\nTreatment\\nEarly, aggressive treatment of all infections is criti-\\ncal to the successful management of CGD. Patients are\\ntreated with antibiotics and immune serum. Antibiotics\\nare used at the first sign of infection. Immune serum is a\\nsource of antibodies that help fight infections. Interferon\\ngamma is an experimental treatment for CGD that has\\nshown promising results. There is no cure for the under-\\nlying cause of chronic granulomatous disease\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough antibiotics can treat most infections and\\nmay help prevent others, premature death may result,\\ntypically due to repeated lung infections.\\nPrevention\\nSince CGD is a hereditary disorder, it cannot cur-\\nrently be prevented.

Lohr, PhD\\nChronic kidney failure\\nDefinition\\nChronic kidney failure occurs when disease or disor-\\nder damages the kidneys so that they are no longer capa-\\nble of adequately removing fluids and wastes from the\\nbody or of maintaining the proper level of certain kidney-\\nregulated chemicals in the bloodstream.\\nDescription\\nChronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal\\nfailure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually. It is\\ncaused by a number of diseases and inherited disorders,\\nbut the progression of chronic kidney failure is always the\\nsame. The kidneys, which serve as the body’s natural fil-\\ntration system, gradually lose their ability to remove flu-\\nids and waste products (urea) from the bloodstream. They\\nalso fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream,\\nand deposit protein into the urine. Chronic kidney failure\\nis irreversible, and will eventually lead to total kidney\\nfailure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\\nWithout proper treatment intervention to remove wastes\\nand fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nKidney failure is triggered by disease or a hereditary\\ndisorder in the kidneys. Both kidneys are typically affect-\\ned. The four most common causes of chronic kidney fail-\\nure include:\\n• Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin depen-\\ndant (IDDM) and non-insulin dependant (NIDDM),\\noccurs when the body cannot produce and/or use\\ninsulin, the hormone necessary for the body to process\\nglucose. Long-term diabetes may cause the glomeruli,\\nthe filtering units located in the nephrons of the kid-\\nneys, to gradually lose functioning.\\n• Glomerulonephritis . Glomerulonephritis is a chronic\\ninflammation of the glomeruli, or filtering units of the\\nkidney. Certain types of glomerulonephritis are treat-\\nable, and may only cause a temporary disruption of kid-\\nney functioning.\\n• Hypertension. High blood pressure is unique in that it\\nis both a cause and a major symptom of kidney failure.\\nThe kidneys can become stressed and ultimately sustain\\npermanent damage from blood pushing through them at\\nan excessive level of pressure over a long period of time.\\n• Polycystic kidney disease. Polycystic kidney disease is\\nan inherited disorder that causes cysts to be formed on\\nthe nephrons, or functioning units, of the kidneys. The\\ncysts hamper the regular functioning of the kidney.\\nOther possible causes of chronic kidney failure\\ninclude kidney cancer , obstructions such as kidney\\nstones, pyelonephritis , reflux nephropathy, systemic\\nlupus erythematosus , amyloidosis , sickle cell anemia,\\nAlport syndrome, and oxalosis.\\nInitially, symptoms of chronic kidney failure devel-\\nop slowly. Even individuals with mild to moderate kid-\\nney failure may show few symptoms in spite of increased\\nurea in their blood. Among the symptoms that may be\\npresent at this point are frequent urination during the\\nnight and high blood pressure.\\nMost symptoms of chronic kidney failure are not\\napparent until kidney disease has progressed significant-\\nly. Common symptoms include:\\n• Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production\\nof erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which stimulates red\\nblood cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking\\nof the kidney, this red cell production is hampered.\\n• Bad breath or a bad taste in mouth. Urea, or waste prod-\\nucts, in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like taste in\\nthe mouth.\\n• Bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\\nD, which aids in the absorption of calcium and keeps\\nbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones\\nmay become brittle, and in the case of children, normal\\ngrowth may be stunted. Joint pain may also occur as a\\nresult of unchecked phosphate levels in the blood.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n806\\nChronic kidney failure'),\n",

Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,\\nhands, and feet.\\n• Frequent urination.\\n• Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause\\nit to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate\\nbleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,\\nor ureters.\\n• Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\\n• Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,\\nwhich in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.\\n• Increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\\npresence of anemia may cause feelings of exhaustion.\\n• Itching . Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in\\nthe urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kid-\\nney failure. This heightened phosphorus level may\\ncause itching of the skin.\\n• Lower back pain. Pain where the kidneys are located, in\\nthe small of the back below the ribs.\\n• Nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Urea in the gas-\\ntric juices may cause upset stomach. This can lead to\\nmalnutritionand weight loss.\\nDiagnosis\\nKidney failure is typically diagnosed and treated by a\\nnephrologist, a doctor that specializes in treating the kid-\\nneys. The patient that is suspected of having chronic kid-\\nney failure will undergo an extensive blood work-up. A\\nblood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood urea\\nnitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potas-\\nsium in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected,\\nusually over a 24-hour period, to assess protein loss.\\nUncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to\\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is nec-\\nessary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable\\nand if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. An x ray,\\nMRI, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, renal\\nbiopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be\\nemployed to determine the cause of kidney failure and\\nlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultra-\\nsound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be taken.\\nTreatment\\nChronic kidney failure is an irreversible condition.\\nHemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplan-\\ntation must be employed to replace the lost function of\\nthe kidneys. In addition, dietary changes and treatment to\\nrelieve specific symptoms such as anemia and high blood\\npressure are critical to the treatment process.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD)—Total kidney fail-\\nure; chronic kidney failure is diagnosed as ESRD\\nwhen kidney function falls to 5–10% of capacity.\\nNephrotic syndrome—Characterized by protein\\nloss in the urine, low protein levels in the blood,\\nand fluid retention.\\nUreters—The two ducts that pass urine from each\\nkidney to the bladder.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type\\nof dialysis treatment in the United States. Most\\nhemodialysis patients require treatment three times a\\nweek, for an average of three to four hours per dialysis\\n“run” depending on the type of dialyzer used and their\\ncurrent physical condition. The treatment involves circu-\\nlating the patient’s blood outside of the body through an\\nextracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The\\ndialysis circuit consists of plastic blood tubing, a two-\\ncompartment filter known as a dialyzer, or artificial kid-\\nney, and a dialysis machine that monitors and maintains\\nblood flow and administers dialysate, a chemical bath\\nused to draw waste products out of the blood. The\\npatient’s blood leaves and enters the body through two\\nneedles inserted into the patient’s vein, called an access\\nsite, and is pushed through the blood compartment of the\\ndialyzer. Once inside of the dialyzer, excess fluids and\\ntoxins are pulled out of the bloodstream and into the\\ndialysate compartment, where they are carried out of the\\nbody. At the same time, electrolytes and other chemicals\\nin the dialysate solution move from the dialysate into the\\nbloodstream. The purified, chemically-balanced blood is\\nthen returned to the body.\\nPeritoneal dialysis\\nIn peritoneal dialysis (PD), the patient’s peritoneum,\\nor lining of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter\\nis surgically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During\\ntreatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity\\nwith dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move\\nfrom the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solu-\\ntion. After a waiting period of six to 24 hours, depending\\non the treatment method used, the waste-filled dialysate\\nis drained from the abdomen, and replaced with clean\\ndialysate. There are three types of peritoneal dialysis,\\nwhich vary by treatment time and administration\\nmethod: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n807\\nChronic kidney failure'),\n",

Patients with chronic renal disease\\nwho need a transplant and don’t have a living donor reg-\\nister with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing),\\nthe federal organ procurement agency, to be placed on a\\nwaiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant. Kidney avail-\\nability is based on the patient’s health status. When the\\nnew kidney is transplanted, the patient’s existing, dis-\\neased kidneys may or may not be removed, depending on\\nthe circumstances surrounding the kidney failure. A regi-\\nmen of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection medication,\\nis required after transplantation surgery.\\nDietary management\\nA diet low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorous,\\nthree substances that the kidneys regulate, is critical in\\nmanaging kidney disease. Other dietary restrictions, such\\nas a reduction in protein, may be prescribed depending\\non the cause of kidney failure and the type of dialysis\\ntreatment employed. Patients with chronic kidney failure\\nalso need to limit their fluid intake.\\nMedications and dietary supplements\\nKidney failure patients with hypertension typically\\ntake medication to control their high blood pressure.\\nEpoetin alfa, or EPO (Epogen), a hormone therapy, and\\nintravenous or oral iron supplements are used to manage\\nanemia. A multivitamin may be prescribed to replace vit-\\namins lost during dialysis treatments. Vitamin D, which\\npromotes the absorption of calcium, along with calcium\\nsupplements, may also be prescribed.\\nSince 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD\\ntreatment costs, including the costs of dialysis and trans-\\nplantation and of some medications. To qualify for bene-\\nfits, a patient must be insured or eligible for benefits\\nunder Social Security, or be a spouse or child of an eligi-\\nble American. Private insurance and state Medicaid pro-\\ngrams often cover the remaining 20% of treatment costs.\\nPrognosis\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure is criti-\\ncal to improving length and quality of life in chronic kidney\\nfailure patients. Patient outcome varies by the cause of\\nchronic kidney failure and the method chosen to treat it.\\nOverall, patients with chronic kidney disease leading to\\nESRD have a shortened lifespan. According to the United\\nStates Renal Data System (USRDS), the lifespan of an\\nESRD patient is 18–47% of the lifespan of the age-sex-race\\nmatched general population. ESRD patients on dialysis\\nhave a lifespan that is 16–37% of the general population.\\nThe demand for kidneys to transplant continues to\\nexceed supply. In 1996, over 34,000 Americans were on\\nthe UNOS waiting list for a kidney transplant, but only\\n11,330 living donor and cadaver transplants were actual-\\nly performed. Cadaver kidney transplants have a 50%\\nchance of functioning nine years, and living donor kid-\\nneys that have two matching antigen pairs have a 50%\\nchance of functioning for 24 years. However, some trans-\\nplant grafts have functioned for over 30 years.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBock, G. H., E. J. Ruley, and M. P. Moore. A Parent’s Guide to\\nKidney Disorders.

COPD commonly refers to two related, progres-\\nsive diseases of the respiratory system, chronic bronchi-\\ntis and emphysema . Because smoking is the major\\ncause of both diseases, chronic bronchitis and emphyse-\\nma often occur together in the same patient.\\nDescription\\nCOPD is one of the fastest-growing health prob-\\nlems. Nearly 16 million people in the United States, 14\\nmillion with chronic bronchitis and two million with\\nemphysema, suffer from COPD. COPD is responsible\\nfor more than 96,000 deaths annually, making it the\\nfourth leading cause of death. Although COPD is more\\ncommon in men than women, the increase in incidence\\nof smoking among women since World War II has pro-\\nduced an increase in deaths from COPD in women.\\nCOPD has a large economic impact on the healthcare\\nsystem and a destructive impact on the lives of patients\\nand their families. Quality of life for a person with\\nCOPD decreases as the disease progresses.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nIn chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation caused\\nby cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of the open-\\nings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the respiratory\\nsystem, and interferes with the flow of air. Inflammation\\nalso causes the glands that line the bronchi to produce\\nexcessive amounts of mucus, further narrowing the air-\\nways and blocking airflow. The result is often a chronic\\ncoughthat produces sputum (mainly mucus) and short-\\nness of breath . Cigarette smoke also damages the cilia,\\nsmall hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreign\\nparticles out of the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.\\nEmphysema\\nEmphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke\\ncauses an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one of\\nthe immune system’s infection-fighting biochemicals.\\nThis results in irreversible destruction of a protein in the\\nlung called elastin which is important for maintaining the\\nstructure of the walls of the alveoli, the terminal small air\\nsacs of the respiratory system. As the walls of the alveoli\\nrupture, the number of alveoli is reduced and many of\\nthose remaining are enlarged, making the lungs of the\\npatient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated.\\nDue to the higher pressure inside the chest that must be\\ndeveloped to force air out of the less-elastic lungs, the\\nbronchioles, small air tubes of the respiratory system,\\ntend to collapse during exhalation. Stale air gets trapped\\nin the air sacs and fresh air cannot be brought in.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are several important risk factors for COPD:\\n• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important\\nrisk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar and pipe\\nsmoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and indus-\\ntrial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.\\n• Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people\\nover 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often in\\npeople 65 years of age and older.\\n• Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are about\\ntwice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled labor-\\ners as among professionals.\\n• Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predispos-\\nes people in certain families to the development of\\nCOPD when other causes, such as smoking and air pol-\\nlution, are present.\\n• Lung infections. Lung infections make all forms of\\nCOPD worse.\\nIn the general population, emphysema usually devel-\\nops in older individuals with a long smoking history. How-\\never, there is also a form of emphysema that runs in fami-\\nlies. People with this type of emphysema have a hereditary\\ndeficiency of a blood component, an enzyme inhibitor\\ncalled alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). This type of emphysema\\nis sometimes called “early onset emphysema” because it\\ncan appear when a person is as young as 30 or 40 years\\nold. It is estimated that there are between 75,000 and\\n150,000 Americans who were born with AAT-deficiency.\\nOf this group, emphysema afflicts an estimated 20,000-\\n40,000 people (1–3% of all cases of emphysema). The risk\\nof developing emphysema for an AAT-deficient individual\\nwho also smokes is much greater than for others.\\nThe first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough\\nand mucus production. These symptoms resemble a chest\\ncold that lingers on for weeks. Later, shortness of breath\\ndevelops. Cough, sputum production, and shortness of\\nbreath may become worse if a person develops a lung\\ninfection.

In emphysema, shortness of\\nbreath on exertion is the predominant early symptom.\\nCoughing is usually minor and there is little sputum. As\\nthe disease progresses, the shortness of breath occurs\\nwith less exertion, and eventually may be present even\\nwhen at rest. At this point, a sputum-producing cough\\nmay also occur. Either chronic bronchitis or emphysema\\nmay lead to respiratory failure—a condition in which\\nthere occurs a dangerously low level of oxygen or a seri-\\nous excess of carbon dioxide in the blood.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step in diagnosing COPD is a good medical\\nevaluation, including a medical history and a physical\\nexamination of the chest using a stethoscope. In addition,\\nthe doctor may request one or more of the following tests:\\nPulmonary function test\\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air\\ntaken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will deter-\\nmine two important values: (1) vital capacity (VC), the largest\\namount of air expelled after the deepest inhalation, and (2)\\nforced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum amount of\\nair expired in one second. The pulmonary function testcan\\nbe performed in the doctor’s office, but is expensive.\\nChest x ray\\nChest x rays can detect only about half of the cases of\\nemphysema. Chest x rays are rarely useful for diagnosing\\nchronic bronchitis.\\nBlood gas levels\\nBlood may be drawn from an artery (more painful\\nthan drawing blood from a vein) to determine the amount\\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide present. Low oxygen and\\nhigh carbon dioxide levels are often indicative of chronic\\nbronchitis, but not always of emphysema.\\nTests for cause of infection\\nIf infection is present, blood and sputum tests may\\nbe done to determine the cause of infection.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nMany patients with lung disease also develop heart\\nproblems. The ECG identifies signs of heart disease.\\nTreatment\\nThe precise nature of the patient’s condition will\\ndetermine the type of treatment prescribed for COPD.\\nWith a program of complete respiratory care, disability\\ncan be minimized, acute episodes prevented, hospitaliza-\\ntions reduced, and some early deaths avoided. On the\\nother hand, no treatment has been shown to slow the\\nprogress of the disease, and only oxygen therapy increas-\\nes survival rate.\\nDrugs\\nMedications frequently prescribed for COPD\\npatients include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n810\\nChronic obstructive lung disease\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nA. lung cancer.

Once a routine operation urged by pediatricians\\nand obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen-\\ntieth century, circumcision has become an elective option\\nthat parents make for their sons on an individual basis.\\nFamilies who practice Judaism or Islam may select to\\nhave their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth-\\ners choose circumcision for medical benefits.\\nFemale circumcision (also known as female genital\\nmutilation) is usually performed for cultural and social\\nreasons by family members and others who are not mem-\\nbers of the medical profession, with no anesthesia. Not\\nonly is the prepuce removed but often the vaginal open-\\ning is sewn to make it smaller. This practice is supposed\\nto ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. It\\nalso prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasure\\nduring coitus. This practice is not universally approved\\nby the medical profession and is considered by some as a\\nhuman rights violation.\\nThough the incidence of male circumcision has\\ndecreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still the\\nmost common surgical operation in the United States.\\nCircumcision rates are much lower for the rest of the\\nindustrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli-\\ngious practices or to correct a specific medical condition\\nof the penis.\\nSome of the medical reasons parents choose cir-\\ncumcision are to protect against infections of the uri-\\nnary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer , lower the\\nrisk of getting sexually transmitted diseases , and pre-\\nvent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that may\\nclose the opening of the penis).

The most common con-\\ndition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, a\\ncongenital deformity of the penis where the urinary tract\\nopening is not at the tip of the glans. Also, infants with a\\nlarge hydrocoele or hernia may suffer important compli-\\ncations through circumcision. Premature infants and\\ninfants with serious infections are also poor candidates to\\nbe circumcised, as are infants with hemophilia , other\\nbleeding disorders, or whose mothers had taken anticoag-\\nulant drugs. In older boys or men, circumcision is a minor\\nprocedure. Therefore, it can be performed in virtually\\nanyone without a serious illness or unusual deformity.\\nDescription\\nThe foreskin of the penis protects the sensitivity of\\nthe glans and shields it from irritation by urine, feces,\\nand foreign materials.

The physician injects local anesthesia at the\\nbase of the penis or under the skin around the penis (sub-\\ncutaneous ring block). Both anesthetics block key\\nnerves. EMLA cream, a topical formula of several anes-\\nthetics can also be used.\\nAftercare\\nAfter circumcision, the wound should be washed\\ndaily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may be\\napplied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress-\\ning will be present and should be changed each time the\\ndiaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is used\\ninstead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in five\\nto eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days.\\nInfants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for\\nsome hours afterward, so parents should be prepared for\\ncrying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generally\\nthese go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may be\\npainful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet-\\nic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporary\\ndiscomfort. There may also be a “bruise” on the penis,\\nwhich typically goes away with no particular attention.\\nRisks\\nComplications following newborn circumcision\\nappear in one out of every 500 procedures.

This type of cirrhosis\\ncan also be detected when complications occur (decom-\\npensated cirrhosis).\\nSymptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the loss\\nof functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to scarring.\\nThe liver enlarges during the early stages of illness. The\\npalms of the hands turn red and patients may experience:\\n• constipation\\n• diarrhea\\n• dull abdominal pain\\n• fatigue\\n• indigestion\\n• loss of appetite\\n• nausea\\n• vomiting\\n• weakness\\n• weight loss\\nAs the disease progresses, the spleen enlarges and\\nfluid collects in the abdomen (ascites) and legs (edema).\\nSpider-like blood vessels appear on the chest and shoul-\\nders, and bruising becomes common. Men sometimes\\nlose chest hair. Their breasts may grow and their testicles\\nmay shrink. Women may have menstrual irregularities.\\nCirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense\\nitching . The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn\\nyellow ( jaundice ), and urine may be dark yellow or\\nbrown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes the\\npatient develops persistent high blood pressure due to the\\nscarring (portal hypertension ). This type of hyperten-\\nsion can be life threatening. It can cause veins to enlarge\\nin the stomach and in the tube leading from the mouth to\\nthe stomach (esophagus). These enlarged veins are called\\nvarices, and they can rupture and bleed massively.\\nOther symptoms of cirrhosis include:\\n• anemia\\n• bleeding gums\\n• decreased interest in sex\\n•f e v e r\\n• fluid in the lungs\\n• hallucinations\\n• lethargy\\n• lightheadedness\\n• muscle weakness\\n• musty breath\\n• painful nerve inflammation (neuritis)\\n• slurred speech\\n• tremors\\nIf the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from the\\nbrain, the patient may have additional symptoms. The\\npatient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglect\\npersonal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquire\\nnew sleeping habits. These symptoms are related to\\nammonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to con-\\nvert ammonia to urea. High protein intake in these\\npatients can also lead to these symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nA patient’s medical history can reveal illnesses or\\nlifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can be\\nseen during a physical examination . A doctor who sus-\\npects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to measure\\nliver function. Because only a small number of healthy\\ncells are needed to carry out essential liver functions, test\\nresults may be normal even when cirrhosis is present.\\nComputed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound,\\nand other imaging techniques can be used during diagno-\\nsis. They can help determine the size of the liver, indicate\\nhealthy and scarred areas of the organ, and detect gall-\\nstones. Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed during surgery\\nor by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This view-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n816\\nCirrhosis'),\n",

In this procedure, a tissue sample is\\nremoved from the liver and is examined under a micro-\\nscope in order to learn more about the organ.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the condi-\\ntion causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease progres-\\nsion, and prevent or treat complications.\\nSalt and fluid intake are often limited, and activity is\\nencouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately high in\\nprotein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vita-\\nmin supplements may be prescribed if the liver continues\\nto deteriorate. Patients are asked not to consume alcohol.\\nMedication\\nIron supplements,diuretics, and antibiotics may be\\nused for anemia, fluid retention, and ammonia accumula-\\ntion associated with cirrhosis. Vasoconstrictors are some-\\ntimes needed to stop internal bleeding and antiemetics\\nmay be prescribed to control nausea.\\nLaxatives help the body absorb toxins and acceler-\\nate their removal from the digestive tract. Beta blockers\\nmay be prescribed to control cirrhosis-induced portal\\nhypertension. Because the diseased liver can no longer\\nefficiently neutralize harmful substances, medications\\nmust be given with caution. Interferon medicines may be\\nused by patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C\\nto prevent post-hepatic cirrhosis.\\nSurgery\\nMedication that causes scarring can be injected\\ndirectly into veins to control bleeding from varices in the\\nstomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special sur-\\ngical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stop\\nthe bleeding. Surgery may be required to repair disease-\\nrelated throat damage. It is sometimes necessary to\\nremove diseased portions of the spleen and other organs.\\nLiver transplants can benefit patients with advanced\\ncirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually become\\ndiseased unless the underlying cause of cirrhosis is\\nremoved. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must demon-\\nstrate a willingness to stop drinking before being consid-\\nered suitable transplant candidates.\\nSupportive measures\\nA balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy\\nliver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout the\\nday should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients\\nwith cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and caf-\\nfeine, which destroy liver cells, should be avoided. So\\nshould any foods that upset the stomach. Patients with\\nbrain disease associated with cirrhosis should avoid\\nexcessive amounts of protein in the diet.\\nA patient can keep a food diary that describes what\\nwas eaten, when it was eaten, and how the patient felt\\nafterwards. This diary can be useful in identifying foods\\nthat are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coin-\\ncide with the times the patient is most hungry.\\nPatients who have cirrhosis should weigh them-\\nselves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden gain\\nof five pounds or more. A doctor should also be notified\\nif symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone who has not\\nbeen diagnosed with the disease. A doctor should also be\\nnotified if a patient diagnosed with cirrhosis:\\n• vomits blood\\n• passes black stools\\n• seems confused or unresponsive\\n• shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness,\\npain)\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at pro-\\nmoting the function of healthy liver cells and relieving the\\nsymptoms associated with the disease. Several herbal\\nremedies may be helpful to cirrhosis patients. Dandelion\\n(Taraxacum officinale ) and rock-poppy ( Chelidonium\\nmajus) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells.\\nMilk thistle extract ( Silybum marianum ) may slow dis-\\nease progression and significantly improve survival rates\\nin alcoholics and other cirrhosis patients. Practitioners of\\nhomeopathyand traditional Chinese medicine can also\\nprescribe treatments that support healthy liver function.\\nPrognosis\\nCirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed,\\nbut further damage can be prevented by patients who:\\n• eat properly\\n• get enough rest\\n• do not consume alcohol\\n• remain free of infection\\nIf the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be cor-\\nrected or removed, scarring will continue.

A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a\\nharelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend into\\nthe base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in the\\nroof of the mouth.\\nDescription\\nBabies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv-\\ning the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from a\\nsmall notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos-\\ntril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip.\\nBabies born with cleft palates have openings in the\\npalate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-\\ntion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in the\\nhard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth,\\nopening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in the\\nsoft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. The\\ncleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate and\\nmay occur on both sides of the center of the palate.\\nBabies may have cleft lips with or without cleft\\npalates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips.\\nThe incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated\\nwith a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri-\\ncans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci-\\ndence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci-\\ndence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. African\\nAmericans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCleft lips and palates not associated with a syn-\\ndrome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi-\\nronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi-\\nnation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genes\\nthat increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When an\\nembryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ-\\nmental factors the embryo develops a cleft.\\nThe risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or\\npalate increases with the number of affected relatives and\\nincreases with relatives that have more severe clefts.\\nEnvironmental factors that increase the risk of cleft\\nlip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2818\\nCleft lip and palate'),\n",

Some drugs also increase the incidence of\\nclefting, such as phenytoin, sodium valproate, and\\nmethotrexate. The pregnant mother’s nutrition may\\naffect the incidence of clefting as well.\\nBabies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an\\nelongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this opening\\nmay range from a small notch in the upper lip to an open-\\ning that extends into the base of the nostril. The cleft lip\\nmay be below the right or left nostril or below both nostrils.\\nBabies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have\\nan opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-\\ntion of the cleft varies and it may involve only the hard\\npalate, or only the soft palate and may occur on both\\nsides of the center of the palate.\\nIn some cases the cleft palate will be covered with\\nthe normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt by\\nthe examiner.\\nBabies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi-\\nculties, which are more severe in babies with cleft\\npalates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby being\\nunable to achieve complete suction. In the case of clefts\\nof the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from the mouth\\nthrough the opening in the hard palate.\\nA cleft palate also affects a child’s speech, since the\\npalate is necessary for speech formation. The child’s\\nspeech pattern may still be affected despite surgical repair.\\nEar infections are more common in babies born with\\ncleft palates. The infections occur because the muscles of\\nthe palate do not open the Eustachian tubes which drain\\nthe middle ear. This allows fluid to collect and increases\\nthe risk of infection and hearing loss.\\nTeeth may also erupt misaligned.\\nDiagnosis\\nCleft lip and palate can be diagnosed before birth by\\nultrasound. After birth, cleft lip and palate are diagnosed\\nby physical exam.\\nTreatment\\nIf cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound\\nbefore birth, further testing may be required to diagnose\\nassociated abnormalities if present. Referral to a cleft\\nteam is essential. A cleft team consists of specialists in\\nthe management of babies with clefts and includes sur-\\ngeons as well as nurses and speech therapists. Members\\nof the team inform the parents of all aspects of manage-\\nment. Feeding methods are also discussed, since feeding\\nis the first problem that must be dealt with. It may be\\npossible to breastfeed a baby born with only a cleft lip,\\nbut babies born with cleft palates usually have more\\nproblems with feeding and frequently require special\\nbottles and teats. A palatal obturator is a device that fits\\ninto the roof of the mouth, thus blocking the cleft open-\\ning and allowing easier suckling.\\nSurgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed\\nafter orthodontic treatment to narrow the gap in the upper\\nlip. The orthodontic treatment can involve acrylic splints\\nwith or without screws or may involve the use of adhesive\\ntape placed across the gap in the lip. The orthodontic treat-\\nment for cleft lip should be started within the first three\\nweeks of life and continue until the cleft lip is repaired.\\nThe timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on the\\njudgment of the surgeon who will perform the operation.\\nThe procedure is usually performed between one and\\nthree months of age. The goals of the operation are to\\nclose the gap in the upper lip, place scars in the natural\\nskin curves and to repair muscle so that the lip appears\\nnormal during movement. The closure is done in the\\nthree layers (skin, muscle, and mucosa) that line the\\ninside of the lip. At the time of the procedure, if the nose\\nis shaped abnormally due to the cleft lip, it is also cor-\\nrected. Sometimes further surgery may be needed on the\\nlip and/or nose to refine the result.\\nThe goals of the surgeon repairing a cleft palate are\\nnormal speech, normal facial growth, and hearing for the\\naffected infant. The repair of the cleft palate is usually per-\\nformed between three and 18 months of age. The timing\\nmay extend beyond this and varies with the type of cleft\\npalate and center where the procedure is being performed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n819\\nCleft lip and palate\\nThis infant has an unilateral cleft lip and palate.(Custom\\nMedical Stock Photo.

CFIs are\\nsometimes referred to as closed fist injuries or fight bites.\\nDescription\\nClenched fist injuries are most common over the\\nmetacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptive\\nbecause they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injury\\nis hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand and\\nstraightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri-\\nous consequences, including infection,cellulitis, inflam-\\nmation of the bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis), septic\\narthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten-\\ndons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma-\\nnent loss of function or amputation.\\nMost CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of\\nimpact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting from\\ncontact with the teeth, and contamination of the wound\\nby the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens his\\nhand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over the\\ndeeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within the\\ninjured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normal\\nmotions of the finger is the reason why clenched fist\\ninjuries have the highest rate of infection of any human\\nbite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries varies\\nfrom 15–50%.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of CFIs include fighting and other forms\\nof aggressive behavior, often combined with drug or\\nalcohol consumption.\\nThe symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain\\nin the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of the\\ninjured finger with limitation of movement. If the patient\\nhas delayed getting medical treatment, there may be evi-\\ndence of infection, including swelling, redness, and sup-\\npuration (a discharge of pus). The skin around the wound\\nwill be warm to the touch and fever may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made\\non the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray find-\\nings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is soft tis-\\nsue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air pockets in\\ndeep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments of teeth, frac-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2820\\nClenched fist injury'),\n",

Diag-\\nnosis is often complicated by the fact that the patient will\\nbe reluctant to admit how the injury happened. The treat-\\ning physician must maintain a high level of suspicion and\\noften ask directly.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of clenched fist injuries is complicated by\\nseveral factors. One factor is the anatomical structure of\\nthe human hand, which contains many small closed\\nspaces that make it easy for infection to spread and per-\\nsist. Another is the number of disease-causing bacteria\\ntransmitted by human bites; at least 42 different species\\nhave been identified. In addition, CFIs typically do not\\nreceive immediate treatment because the patient is con-\\ncerned about legal consequences. The longer the delay,\\nthe higher the chances of infection and permanent dam-\\nage to the hand. Patients who wait longer than 24 hours\\nto seek treatment or have signs of infection or damage to\\nthe tendon, joint capsule, or bones are usually referred\\nimmediately to a doctor who specializes in hand surgery.\\nThe first step in treatment of clenched fist injury is irri-\\ngation, a procedure by which the wound is flushed with a\\nstream of water under high pressure or with an antiseptic\\nsolution. Incision and drainage of the wound (I&D) may be\\nrequired as well as debridement, the surgical removal of\\ndead tissue and foreign objects from a wound. Careful\\nexamination of the depth of the wound is essential to prop-\\ner treatment. The surgeon may need to enlarge the sides of\\nthe wound in order to make an accurate evaluation. The\\npatient will be asked to move the affected joint through its\\nfull range of motion so that the surgeon can determine\\nwhether the tendon or joint capsule has been damaged. Fol-\\nlowing these procedures, the surgeon will pack the wound\\nand put the hand in a splint. Bite wounds are never sutured\\n(sewn shut) because of the possibility of enclosing bacteria\\ninside the injury. After 24 hours, the packing will be\\nremoved and the hand reexamined for signs of infection.\\nIf the wound has become infected, the patient is usu-\\nally hospitalized and given parenteral (injectable) antibi-\\notics. The wound is irrigated and examined to determine\\nthe extent of the injury. Cultures are taken for both aerobic\\n(requiring air or oxygen to live) and anaerobic (not requir-\\ning air or oxygen) species of bacteria. The cultures should\\nbe taken from areas deep in the wound rather than from\\nthe surface for greater accuracy. Tetanustoxoid should be\\ngiven if the patient has not been immunized within the last\\n10 years. The patient should also receive treatment and\\nfollow-up for the rare possibility of HIV and hepatitis\\ntransmission. Although no well-documented cases of HIV\\ntransmission by human bites exist as of 2001, the potential\\nfor transmission by this route is still present.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibiotic—A chemical substance produced by a\\nmicroorganism which can inhibit the growth of or\\nkill other microorganisms.\\nDebridement—Surgical removal of damaged tis-\\nsue and foreign objects from a wound.\\nI&D—Incision and drainage of a wound.\\nIrrigation—Cleansing a wound with large amounts\\nof water and/or an antiseptic solution.\\nParenteral—Administered inside the body but out-\\nside the digestive tract.\\nTetanus toxoid—Tetanus toxoid is a vaccine used\\nto prevent tetanus (also known as lockjaw).\\nInfected clenched fist injuries usually contain sever-\\nal disease-causing bacteria, the most common being\\nStreptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus , Bac-\\nteroides sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., and Eikenella corro-\\ndens.

The condition\\nis also known as talipes.\\nDescription\\nTrue clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for-\\nmation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot,\\nincluding talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines,\\nand talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most common\\nform of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so that\\nthe leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipes\\nvalgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal-\\nipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that of\\na toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward,\\nwith the heel pointing down.\\nClubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an\\ninfant’s feet appear abnormal at birth because of the\\nintrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is no\\nanatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club-\\nfoot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply-\\ning special braces or casts to straighten the foot.\\nThe ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to\\n1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In the\\nUnited States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every\\n1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over-\\nall incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children; by 1994,\\nthat number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 live\\nbirths. No reason was offered for the increase.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nExperts do not agree on the precise cause of club-\\nfoot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance has\\nbeen extensively investigated using family studies and\\nother epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitive\\nconclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat-\\ntern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to the\\ninteraction of several different inheritance patterns, dif-\\nferent patterns of development appearing as the same\\ncondition, or a complex interaction between genetic and\\nenvironmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ-\\nated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001,\\nthese findings have not been replicated in humans.\\nA family history of clubfoot has been reported in\\n24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug-\\ngest the potential role of one or more genes being respon-\\nsible for clubfoot.\\nSeveral environmental causes have been proposed\\nfor clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowd-\\ning causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a sig-\\nnificantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twins\\ncompared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure to\\nthe drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot.\\nMisoprostol is commonly used when trying, usually\\nunsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and in\\nother countries in South and Central America.\\nResearchers in Norway have reported that males who\\nare in the printing trades have significantly more off-\\nspring with clubfoot than men in other occupations.\\nFor unknown reasons,amniocentesis , a prenatal test,\\nhas also been associated with clubfoot. The infants of\\nmothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater\\nchance of being born with clubfoot than are offspring\\nof women who do not smoke.\\nTrue clubfoot is usually obvious at birth.

Since the condition starts in the\\nfirst trimester of pregnancy, the abnormality is quite well\\nestablished at birth, and the foot is often very rigid.\\nUncorrected clubfoot in an adult causes only part of the\\nfoot, usually the outer edge, or the heel or the toes, to\\ntouch the ground. For a person with clubfoot, walking\\nbecomes difficult or impossible.\\nDiagnosis\\nTrue clubfoot is usually recognizable and obvious\\non physical examination. A routine x ray of the foot that\\nshows the bones to be malformed or misaligned supplies\\na confirmed diagnosis of clubfoot. Ultrasonography is\\nnot always useful in diagnosing the presence of clubfoot\\nprior to the birth of a child.\\nTreatment\\nMost orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial treat-\\nment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot should be\\nnon-operative. Non-surgical treatment should begin in\\nthe first days of life to take advantage of the favorable\\nfibro-elastic properties of the foot’s connective tissues,\\nthose forming the ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons.\\nIn a common treatment, a series of casts is applied over a\\nperiod of months to reposition the foot into a normal\\nalignment. In mild cases, splinting and wearing braces at\\nnight may correct the abnormality.\\nWhen clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,\\nthe condition is usually not completely correctable,\\nalthough significant improvement is possible. In the most\\nsevere cases, surgery may be required, especially when\\nthe Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the calf\\nto the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened. Because\\nan early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring and stiff-\\nness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed until an\\naffected child is at least three months old.\\nMuch of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by\\nthe use of manipulation and casting during the first three\\nmonths of life. Proper manipulative techniques must be\\nfollowed by applications of appropriately molded plaster\\ncasts to provide effective and safe correction of most\\nvarieties of clubfoot. Long-term care by an orthopedist is\\nrequired after initial treatment to ensure that the correc-\\ntion of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, correc-\\ntive shoes, or nighttime splints may be needed until the\\nchild stops growing.\\nPrognosis\\nWith prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is usually\\ncorrectable. Most individuals are able to wear regular\\nshoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriate-\\nly treated, the abnormality becomes fixed. This has an\\neffect on the growth of the leg and foot, and some degree\\nof permanent disability usually results.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHall, Judith G. “Chromosomal Clinical Abnormalilties.” In\\nNelson Textbook of Pediatrics.16th ed.

The pain\\nlasts for one to two hours on average and may recur sev-\\neral times in a day.\\nDescription\\nCluster headaches have been known as histamine\\nheadaches, red migraines, and Horton’s disease, among\\nothers. The constant factor is the pain, which transcends\\nby far the distress of the more common tension-type\\nheadacheor even that of a migraine headache.\\nCluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the popu-\\nlation and predominantly affect men; approximately 80%\\nof sufferers are male. Onset typically occurs in the late\\n20s, but there is no absolute age restriction. Approximate-\\nly 80% of cluster headaches are classified as episodic; the\\nremaining 20% are considered chronic. Both display the\\nsame symptoms. However, episodic cluster headaches\\noccur during one- to five-month periods followed by six-\\nto 24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There is\\nno such reprieve for chronic cluster headache sufferers.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBiochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes\\ninduce cluster headaches, but why these changes occur\\nremains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to be\\nlinked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a con-\\nnection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol, tobac-\\nco, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches.\\nDecreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also act\\nas a trigger, particularly during the night when an indi-\\nvidual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not cause\\ncluster headaches during remission periods.\\nThe primary cluster headache symptom is excruciat-\\ning one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or near\\nthe temple. This pain may radiate outward from the ini-\\ntial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth. For this\\nreason, some cluster headache sufferers may mistakenly\\nattribute their pain to a dental problem. Secondary symp-\\ntoms, occurring on the same side as the pain, include eye\\ntearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupil\\ncontraction, and facial drooping or flushing.\\nDiagnosis\\nCluster headache symptoms guide the diagnosis.

The\\nfirst two therapies are prophylactic treatments, geared\\ntoward preventing headaches. Symptomatic therapy is\\nmeant to stop or shorten a headache.\\nInduction and maintenance therapies begin together.\\nInduction therapy is intended to break the headache cycle\\nwith drugs such as corticosteroids (for example, pred-\\nnisone) or dihydroergotamine. These drugs are not meant\\nfor long-term therapy, but rather as a jump-start for main-\\ntenance therapy. Maintenance therapy drugs include ver-\\napamil, lithium carbonate, ergotamine, and methy-\\nsergide. These drugs have long-term effectiveness, but\\nmust be taken for at least a week before a response is\\nobserved. With long-term treatment, methysergide must\\nbe stopped for one month each year to avoid dangerous\\nside effects (formation of fibrous tissue inside the\\nabdominal artery, lungs, and heart valves).\\nDespite prophylactic treatment, headaches may still\\noccur.

Some cluster\\nheadaches may be an allergic response triggered by food or\\nenvironmental substances, therefore identifying and\\nremoving the allergen(s) may be key to resolution of the\\nproblem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of cluster\\nheadaches, and this response may be controlled with vita-\\nmin C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain\\n(pineapple enzyme).

The most com-\\nmonly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia, a con-\\ndition in which patients bleed for long periods of time\\nbefore clotting. There are other coagulation disorders\\nwith a variety of causes.\\nDescription\\nCoagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex\\nprocess involving several components of the blood. Plas-\\nma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a number\\nof proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleed-\\ning. Platelets, small colorless fragments in the blood, ini-\\ntiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that less\\nblood is lost. They also help plug damaged blood vessels\\nand work with plasma to accelerate blood clotting. A dis-\\norder affecting platelet production or one of the many\\nsteps in the entire process can disrupt clotting.\\nCoagulation disorders arise from different causes\\nand produce different complications. Some common\\ncoagulation disorders are:\\n• Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency),\\nan inherited coagulation disorder, affects about 20,000\\nAmericans. This genetic disorder is carried by females\\nbut most often affects males.\\n• Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or Fac-\\ntor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia A\\nwith similar in symptoms.\\n• Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder, also\\nknown as consumption coagulopathy, occurs as a result\\nof other diseases and conditions. This disease acceler-\\nates clotting, which can actually cause hemorrhage.\\n• Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of\\ncoagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of cir-\\nculating platelets in the blood. This disease also\\nincludes idiopathic thrombocytopenia.\\n• V on Willebrand’s disease is a hereditary disorder with\\nprolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor defi-\\nciency and impaired platelet function. It is the most\\ncommon hereditary coagulation disorder.\\n• Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of\\nclotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage.\\n• Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficien-\\ncy, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII defi-\\nciency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 people\\nand is the second most common bleeding disorder\\namong women. Factor VII is also called serum pro-\\nthrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency.\\nOne in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this disor-\\nder that is often diagnosed in newborns because of\\nbleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic delivery.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome coagulation disorders present symptoms such\\nas severe bruising. Others will show no apparent symp-\\ntoms, but carry the threat of severe internal bleeding.\\nHemophilia\\nBecause of its hereditary nature, hemophilia A may\\nbe suspected before symptoms occur. Some signs of\\nhemophilia A are numerous large, deep bruises and pain\\nand swelling of joints caused by internal bleeding.\\nPatients with hemophilia do not bleed faster, just longer.\\nA person with mild hemophilia may first discover the\\ndisorder with prolonged bleeding following a surgical\\nprocedure.

Women usually do not show\\nsigns of hemophilia but are carriers of the disease. Each\\nmale child of the carrier has a 50% chance of having\\nhemophilia, and each female child has a 50% chance of\\npassing the gene on.\\nChristmas disease\\nChristmas disease, or hemophilia B, is also heredi-\\ntary but less common than hemophilia A. The severity of\\nChristmas disease varies from mild to severe, although\\nmild cases are more common. The severity depends on\\nthe degree of deficiency of the Factor IX (clotting factor).\\nHemophilia B symptoms are similar to those of hemo-\\nphilia A, including numerous, large, and deep bruises\\nand prolonged bleeding. The more dangerous symptoms\\nare those that represent possible internal bleeding, such\\nas swelling of joints, or bleeding into internal organs\\nupon trauma. Hemophilia most often occurs in families\\nwith a known history of the disease, but occasionally,\\nnew cases will occur in families with no apparent history.\\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\\nThe name of this disorder arises from the fact that\\nmalfunction of clotting factors cause platelets to clot in\\nsmall blood vessels throughout the body. This action leads\\nto a lack of clotting factors and platelets at a site of injury\\nthat requires clotting. Patients with disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation (DIC) will bleed abnormally even\\nthough there is no history of coagulation abnormality.\\nSymptoms may include minute spots of hemorrhage on\\nthe skin, and purple patches or hematomas caused by\\nbleeding in the skin. A patient may bleed from surgery or\\nintravenous injection (IV) sites. Related symptoms include\\nvomiting, seizures,coma, shortness of breath , shock,\\nsevere pain in the back, muscles, abdomen, or chest.\\nDIC is not a hereditary disorder or a common one. It\\nis most commonly caused by complications during preg-\\nnancy or delivery, overwhelming infections, acute\\nleukemia, metastatic cancer, extensive burns and trauma,\\nand even snakebites. There are a number of other causes\\nof DIC, and it is not commonly understood why or how\\nthese various disorders can lead to the coagulation prob-\\nlem. What the underlying causes of DIC have in common\\nis some factor that affects proteins, platelets, or other clot-\\nting factors and processes.

It is a hereditary disor-\\nder that affects both males and females. In rare cases, it\\nmay be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleed-\\ning in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleeding\\nafter surgery, and abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding.\\nNosebleeds and blood in the stool with a black, tarlike\\nappearance are also signs of V on Willebrand’s disease.\\nHypoprothrombinemia\\nThis disorder is a deficiency in prothrombin, or Factor\\nII, a glycoprotein formed and stored in the liver. Prothrom-\\nbin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin,\\nwhich activates fibrin and begins the process of coagula-\\ntion. Some patients may show no symptoms, and others\\nwill suffer severe hemorrhaging. Patients may experience\\neasy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage,\\nexcessively prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, and\\npostsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may also\\nbe acquired rather than inherited, and usually results from a\\nVitamin K deficiencycaused by liver diseases, newborn\\nhemorrhagic disease, or a number of other factors.\\nOther coagulation disorders\\nFactor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs more\\nfrequently among certain ethnic groups, with an incidence\\nof about one in 10,000 among Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly\\n50% of patients with this disorder experience no symp-\\ntoms, but others may notice blood in their urine, nose-\\nbleeds, or bruising. Although joint bleeding seldom occurs,\\nsome factor XI patients will experience bleeding long after\\nan injury occurs. Some women will experience prolonged\\nbleeding after childbirth. Patients with factor VII deficien-\\ncy vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women may\\nexperience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from the\\ngums or nose, bleeding deep within the skin, and episodes\\nof bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract.\\nFactor VII patients may also suffer bleeding into joints.\\nDiagnosis\\nSeveral blood tests can be used to detect various\\ncoagulation disorders. There are hundreds of different\\ntests a doctor can order to look for indications of specific\\ndiseases. In addition to blood tests, physicians will com-\\nplete a medical history and physical examination. In the\\ncase of acquired coagulation disorders, information such\\nas prior or current diseases and medications will be\\nimportant in determining the cause of the blood disorder.\\n• Hemohilia A will be diagnosed with laboratory tests\\ndetecting presence of clotting factor VIII, factor IX, and\\nothers, as well as the presence or absence of clotting\\nfactor inhibitors.\\n• Christmas disease will be checked against normal\\nbleeding and clotting time, as well as for abnormal\\nserum reagents in factor IX deficiency. Other tests of\\nprothrombin timeand thromboplastic generation may\\nalso be ordered.\\n• There is no one test or group of tests that can always\\nmake (or exclude) a diagnosis of DIC. DIC can be diag-\\nnosed through a number of laboratory tests which mea-\\nsure concentration of platelets and fibrinogen in the\\nblood with normal counts and prolonged prothrombin\\ntime. Other supportive data include diminished levels\\nof factors V , fibrinogen, and VIII, decreased hemoglo-\\nbin, and others. Since many of the test results also indi-\\ncate other disorders, the physician may have to put\\ntogether several results to reach a diagnosis of DIC.\\nSerial tests may also be recommended, because a single\\nexamine at one moment in time may not reveal the\\nprocess that is occurring.\\n• Tests for thrombocytopenia include coagulation tests\\nrevealing a decreased platelet count, prolonged bleed-\\ning time, and other measurements. If these tests indi-\\ncate that platelet destruction is causing the disorder, the\\nphysician may order bone marrow examination.\\n• V on Willebrand’s disease will be diagnosed with the\\nassistance of laboratory tests which show prolonged\\nbleeding time, absent or reduced levels of factor VIII,\\nnormal platelet count, and others.\\n• Hypothrombinemia is diagnosed with history informa-\\ntion and the use of tests that measure vitamin K defi-\\nciency, deficiency of prothrombin, and clotting factors\\nV , VII, IX, and X.\\n• Factor XI deficiency is diagnosed most often after\\ninjury-related bleeding.

Severe bleeding\\nepisodes will require transfusions of human blood clot-\\nting factors. Hemophiliacs are encouraged to receive\\nphysical therapy to help damaged joints and to exercise\\nin non-contact sports such as swimming, bicycle riding,\\nor walking.\\n• Christmas disease patients are treated similarly to\\nhemophilia A patients. There are commercial products\\nand human blood products available to provide coagu-\\nlation. Cryoprecipitate was invented in 1965 to replace\\nthe need for whole plasma transfusions, which intro-\\nduced more volume than needed. By the 1970s, people\\nwere able to infuse themselves with freeze-dried clot-\\nting factor. Superficial wounds can be cleaned and ban-\\ndaged. Parents of hemophiliac children receiving\\nimmunizations should inform the vaccination provider\\nin advance to decrease the possibility of bleeding prob-\\nlems. These children should probably not receive injec-\\ntions which go into the muscle.\\n• Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation\\npatients is complicated by the large variety of underly-\\ning causes of the disorder. If at all possible, the physi-\\ncian will first treat this underlying disorder. If the\\npatient is not already bleeding, this supportive treat-\\nment may eliminate the DIC. However, if bleeding is\\noccurring, the patient may need blood, platelets, fresh\\nfrozen plasma, or other blood products. Heparin has\\nbeen controversial in treating DIC, but it is often used\\nas a last resort to stop hemorrhage. Heparin has not\\nproven useful in treating patients with DIC resulting\\nfrom heat stroke, exotic snakebites, trauma, mis-\\nmatched transfusions, and acute problems resulting\\nfrom obstetrical complications.\\n• Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated\\nby treating the underlying cause or disorder. The specif-\\nic treatment may depend on the underlying cause.\\nSometimes, cortocoosterids or immune globulin may\\nbe given to improve platelet production.\\n• V on Willebrand’s disease is treated by several methods\\nto reduce bleeding time and to replace factor VIII,\\nwhich consequently will replace the V on Willebrand\\nfactor. This may include infusion of cryoprecipitate or\\nfresh frozen plasma. Desmopressin may also help raise\\nlevels of the V on Willebrand factor.\\n• Hypoprothrombinemia may be treated with concen-\\ntrates of prothrombin. Vitamin K may also be produced,\\nand in bleeding episodes, the patient may receive fresh\\nplasma products.\\n• Factor XI (hemophilia C) is most often treated with\\nplasma, since there are no commercially available con-\\ncentrates of factor XI in the United States. Factor VII\\npatients may be treated with prothrombin complex con-\\ncentrates. As of early 1998, factor VII concentrate was\\nnot licensed in the United States and could only be used\\nwith special permission.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThis can be a very severe condition and should be\\nmanaged by a practitioner of alternative medicine in con-\\njunction with a medical doctor; this condition should not\\nbe self managed. For patients known to suffer from hemo-\\nphilia A or B and other bleeding disorders, avoidance of\\nactivities that can cause severe injury should be practiced.\\nComprehensive care addresses the whole person by help-\\ning to deal with the psychosocial aspects of the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for patients with mild forms of coag-\\nulation disorders is normally good. Many people can\\nlead a normal life and maintain a normal life expectancy.\\nWithout treatment of bleeding episodes, severe muscle\\nand joint pain, and eventually, damage, can occur. Any\\nincident that causes blood to collect in the head, neck, or\\ndigestive system can be very serious and requires imme-\\ndiate attention. DIC can be severe enough to cause clots\\nto form and a stroke could occur. DIC is also serious\\nenough to cause gangrene in the fingers, nose, or geni-\\ntals. The prognosis depends on early intervention and\\ntreatment of the underlying condition. Hemorrhage from\\na coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain or\\ndigestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients who\\nreceived regular transfusions of human blood products\\nwere subject to increased risk of AIDS and other dis-\\neases. However, efforts have been made since the early\\n1990s to ensure the safety of the blood supply.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired\\ndisorders may only be prevented by preventing onset of the\\nunderlying disorder (such as cirrhosis). Hereditary disor-\\nders can be predicted with prenatal testing and genetic\\ncounseling. Prevention of severe bleeding episodes may be\\naccomplished by refraining from activities that could cause\\ninjury, such as contact sports. Open communication with\\nhealthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that could\\ncause bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBellenir, Karen.

Coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed in both\\nnewborns and adults. Approximately 10% of newborns with\\ncongenital heart diseasehave coarctation of the aorta.\\nDescription\\nBlood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle\\nand is distributed to the body by arteries. The aortic arch\\nis the first artery to carry blood as it leaves the heart.\\nOther arteries to the head and arms branch off the aortic\\narch. A narrowing of the aorta at any spot produces resis-\\ntance to the flow of blood. This causes high blood pres-\\nsure before the narrowing and low pressure below the nar-\\nrowing (downstream). Parts of the body supplied by arter-\\nies that branch off the aortic arch before the narrowing\\nhave high blood pressure, while most of the lower body\\ndoesn’t receive enough blood supply. To compensate for\\nthis, the heart works harder, and the blood pressure rises.\\nApproximately half of all infants with coarctation of\\nthe aorta are diagnosed within the first two months of\\nlife. Frequently, there are other congenital cardiac com-\\nplications present. Infants with Turner syndromehave a\\n45% rate of also having coarctation. There is evidence\\nthat some cases of coarctation may be inherited.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn newborns with congenital heart disease, coarcta-\\ntion of the aorta develops while the baby is in the womb.\\nAmong the consequences of coarctation of the aorta is\\nventricular hypertrophy, an enlarging of the left ventricle\\nin response to the increased back pressure of the blood\\nand the demand for more blood by the body. Symptoms\\nin infants include shortness of breath (dyspnea), diffi-\\nculty in feeding, and poor weight gain. Older children\\nusually don’t have symptoms, but may display fatigue,\\nshortness of breath, or a feeling of lameness in their legs.\\nDiagnosis\\nInfants usually have an abnormal “gallop” heart\\nrhythm and may also have heart murmurs . Sometimes\\nexcessive arterial pulses can be seen in the carotid and\\nsuprasternal notch arteries, indicating increased pressure\\nin these arteries, while the femoral pulse is weak or can’t\\nbe detected. The systolic pressure is higher in the arms\\nthan in the legs. Enlargement of the heart can be seen in x\\nrays. Similar symptoms are seen in older children and\\nadults. A 10 mm Hg (mercury) pressure difference\\nbetween the upper and lower extremities is diagnostic for\\ncoarctation of the aorta. For some patients, the systolic\\npressure difference is observed only during exercise .\\nInfants frequently have an abnormal electrocardiogram\\n(ECG) that indicates that the right or both ventricles are\\nenlarged, while in older children the ECG may be normal\\nor show that the left ventricle is enlarged. The coarctation\\nmay be detected in echocardiographic examination.\\nTreatment\\nDrugs can be used to treat the hypertension and\\nheart failure . Surgery is recommended for infants with\\nother, associated cardiac defects and for those infants not\\nresponding to drug therapy. Surgery is indicated for\\ninfants that don’t require immediate surgery, but who\\ndevelop severe hypertension during the first several\\nmonths of life. Patients are advised to avoid vigorous\\nexercise prior to surgical correction of the coarctation.\\nRecoarctation can occur in some patients, even if they\\nhave had surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nApproximately half of all infants diagnosed with\\ncoarctation of the aorta have no other cardiac defects and\\nwill respond well to medical management. Most of these\\nchildren will eventually outgrow the condition after sev-\\neral years of life. Although their hypertension may\\nincrease for several months early in life, it will eventually\\ndecrease as the circulatory system develops. Surgery is\\nrequired for infants that have severe coarctation of the\\naorta or have associated cardiac defects.

Usually associ-\\nated with heart or lung diseases.\\nElectrocardiogram—A graph of the heart’s beating\\nproduced by an instrument that detects the electri-\\ncal signals made by the heart.\\n“toot.” It is most commonly inhaled or “snorted.” It may\\nalso be dissolved in water and injected.\\nCrack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces\\nan immediate and more intense high. It comes in off-\\nwhite chunks or chips called “rocks.” Little crumbs of\\ncrack are sometimes called “kibbles & bits.”\\nIn addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and\\ncrack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine\\nmay be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug of\\nabuse, known as “cat,” that is similar to methampheta-\\nmine) to create a “wildcat.” A hollowed-out cigar filled\\nwith a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a\\n“woolah.” And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc-\\ntion with heroin is called a “speedball.” Cocaine used\\ntogether with alcohol represents the most common fatal\\ntwo-drug combination.\\nHistory\\nCocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive\\ndrugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by\\nthe Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region of\\nSouth America for thousands of years, both as a stimu-\\nlant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia (altitude\\nsickness).\\nDespite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not\\nuntil the latter part of the nineteenth century that the\\nactive ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, was\\nfirst extracted from those leaves. The new drug soon\\nbecame a common ingredient in patent medicines and\\nother popular products (including the original formula\\nfor Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con-\\ncerns about the drug’s negative effects. In the early\\n1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address\\nthose concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the use\\nof cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod-\\nucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declined\\nsubstantially.\\nThe drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed\\ninterest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s,\\nuse of the drug had once again become a national prob-\\nlem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early\\n1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on the\\nincrease in certain geographic areas and among certain\\nage groups.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is\\nthe result of a complex combination of internal and\\nexternal factors.

Like other commonly abused addictive drugs,\\ncocaine’s effects are related to the action of the neuro-\\ntransmitter dopamine, which carries information between\\nneurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioning\\nof neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, which\\nbuilds up in the synapses and is believed to cause the\\npleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users.\\nShort-term effects of use\\nThe short-term effects of cocaine can include:\\n• rapid heartbeat\\n• constricted blood vessels\\n• dilated pupils\\n• increased temperature\\n• increased energy\\n• reduced appetite\\n• increased sense of alertness\\n• euphoria\\n•death due to overdose\\nLong-term effects of use\\nThe long-term effects of cocaine and crack use\\ninclude:\\n• dependence, addiction\\n• irritability\\n• mood swings\\n• restlessness\\n• weight loss\\n• auditory hallucinations\\n• paranoia\\nCocaine use and pregnancy\\nThe rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of\\ncrack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its\\neffects on the developing fetus and, since then, several\\nresearch reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use\\ncould be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn,\\nand child development problems. According to the The\\nLindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many of\\nthese early reports had methodological flaws, and most\\nresearchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu-\\nsions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi-\\ndence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatal\\ncare and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac-\\ntors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine\\nusers. Research sponsored by the National Institute on\\nDrug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein Medical\\nCenter in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen-\\nter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatal\\ncare is associated with undesirable effects often attrib-\\nuted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth\\nweight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for Disease\\nControl and Prevention (CDC) however, reports that\\nmothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five\\ntimes as likely to have a baby with a malformation of the\\nurinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus,\\ncocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis-\\nable, especially since it is also often associated with the\\nuse of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental\\nproblems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expecting\\nmother so as to discourage cocaine use remains an\\nimportant task for all health caregivers.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult.\\nMany of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not\\nobvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs,\\nit may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drug\\nfrom another.\\nCocaine use has been documented in significant\\nnumbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over all\\nage groups, more men than women use the drug. The\\nhighest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to\\n25 years old.\\nMedical complications\\nCocaine has been linked to several serious health\\nproblems, including:\\n• arrhythmia\\n• heart attacks\\n• chest pain\\n• respiratory failure\\n• strokes\\n• seizures\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n832\\nCocaine'),\n",

Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that\\nfungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists in\\nthree forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms.\\nThe chronic form can develop as many as 20 years after\\ninitial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed,\\ninjured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi-\\nnated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid-\\nioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affecting\\nmany organ systems and is often fatal.\\nDescription\\nCoccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The\\nfungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert\\nsoil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen-\\ntral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some-\\ntimes called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or desert\\nfever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys of\\nCalifornia. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid-\\nioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occur\\nin only one out of every 100,000 people.\\nAlthough anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm\\nlaborers, construction workers, and archaeologists who\\nwork where it is dusty are at greater risk to become\\ninfected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis,\\nbut the disease most commonly occurs in the 25–55 age\\ngroup. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects men\\nand women equally.\\nChronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy-\\ncosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women.\\nAlthough it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20\\ntimes more likely to develop the disseminated form of\\nthe disease than caucasians. People who have a weak-\\nened immune system (immunocompromised), either\\nfrom diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result\\nof medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor-\\nticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely to develop\\ndisseminated coccidioidomycosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhen the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can\\nbecome lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localized\\ninflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid-\\nioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one person\\nto another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect-\\ned exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other\\n40%, symptoms appear 10–30 days after exposure.\\nThese symptoms include a fever which can reach 104°F\\n(39.5°C), dry cough, chest pains, joint and muscle aches,\\nheadache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the\\nstart of the fever, some people develop a painful red rash\\nor lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappear\\nwithout treatment in about one month. People who have\\nbeen infected gain partial immunity to reinfection.\\nThe chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally\\noccurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur-\\ning which the patient experiences no symptoms of the\\ndisease.

However, a skin test similar to that for tubercu-\\nlosis will determine whether a person has been infected.\\nThe test is simple and accurate, but it does not indicate\\nwhether the disease was limited to its acute form or if it\\nhas progressed to its chronic form.\\nDiagnosis of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomy-\\ncosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or other\\nbody fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A blood\\nserum test is used to detect the presence of an antibody pro-\\nduced in response to C. immitis infection. Chest x rays are\\noften used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead to\\na definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because other\\ndiseases can produce similar results on the x ray.\\nTreatment\\nIn most cases of acute coccidioidomycosis, the\\nbody’s own immune system is adequate to bring about\\nrecovery without medical intervention. Fever and pain\\ncan be treated with non-prescription drugs.\\nChronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis, how-\\never, are serious diseases that require treatment with pre-\\nscription drugs. Patients with intact immune systems who\\ndevelop chronic coccidiodomycosis are treated with the\\ndrug ketoconazole (Nizoral) or amphotericin B (Fungi-\\nzone). Patients with suppressed immune systems are treat-\\ned with amphotericin B (Fungizone). Amphotericin B is a\\npowerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic side\\neffects. As a result, hospitalization is required in order to\\nmonitor patients. The patient may also receive other drugs\\nto minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B.\\nPatients with AIDS must continue to take itracona-\\nzole (Sporonox) or fluconazole (Diflucan) orally or\\nreceive weekly intravenous doses of amphotericin B for\\nthe rest of their lives in order to prevent a relapse.\\nBecause of the high cost of fluconazole, Pfizer, the man-\\nKEY TERMS\\nAbscess —An area of inflamed and injured body\\ntissue that fills with pus.\\nAcidophilus—The bacteria Lactobacillus aci-\\ndophilus that usually found in yogurt.\\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreign\\nprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nAntigen—A foreign protein to which the body\\nreacts by making antibodies.\\nAsymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease but\\nwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are\\nsaid to be asymptomatic.\\nBifidobacteria—A group of bacteria normally pre-\\nsent in the intestine.

Since the spinal\\ncord ends just before the coccyx begins, coccygeal verte-\\nbrae also lack a central foramen (hole). In the coccyx, the\\nvertebrae generally fuse together in early adulthood and\\nmay also fuse with the sacrum, the bone located between\\nthe 5th lumbar vertebra and the coccyx, as a person ages.\\nIn males, the coccyx curves downward, and in females, it\\nis straighter to allow a baby to pass through the birth\\ncanal without impediment.\\nPain in or around the coccyx is called coccydynia or\\ncoccygodynia. Coccydynia presents a range of symptoms\\nassociated to a variety of underlying causes and conditions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nCoccydynia can be caused by a number of factors.\\nUsually, patients report pain after a fall onto their but-\\ntocks, as occurs when going down stairs or while skating.\\nOthers have pain during pregnancy or after childbirth.\\nSome experience repetitive strain from rowing or cycling,\\nand some cite anal intercourse as the cause of pain. In\\nmany cases, pain derives from a malformation of the coc-\\ncyx itself. Sometimes bony spurs appear on the coccyx,\\nbut only seem to be painful in thin patients who do not\\nhave the padding to protect the region from the spur.\\nOther causes of coccydynia include cancer or dam-\\nage to the sacrum that generates referred pain, meaning\\npain that appears in one region but originates from anoth-\\ner. Muscle strain or tension, pinched nerves or damaged\\nnerves, or dislocation of the coccyx due to gross obesity\\nare other causes.\\nSymptoms\\nThe most common symptom of coccydynia, irre-\\nspective of the cause of the condition, is pain when sit-\\nting, or when rising from a sitting position. If the condi-\\ntion lasts long enough, the patient may even experience\\npain when standing or lying down. Sometimes, numb-\\nness occurs in the lower part of the spine. Some patients\\nwill experience pain during bowel movements, sexual\\nintercourse, or menstruation.\\nSecondary symptoms include back pain from sitting\\nin odd positions in order to relieve pain, and painful feet\\nfrom standing too much, because patients avoid sitting.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n836\\nCoccyx injuries'),\n",

The most common type of deaf-\\nness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, the\\nhearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu-\\nlate the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals to\\nthe brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearing\\nnerve remains unstimulated, and the person can’t hear.\\nHair cells can be destroyed by many things, including\\ninfection, trauma, loud noise,aging, or birth defects.\\nAll cochlear implants consist of a microphone\\nworn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends it\\nalong a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in a\\nsmall shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processor\\nboosts the sound, filters out background noise, and\\nturns sound into digital signals before sending it to a\\ntransmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds the\\ntransmitter in place through its attraction to the\\nreceiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical-\\nly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiver\\npicks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, and\\nconverts them into electrical impulses. These electrical\\nimpulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow,\\nflexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea.\\nAs many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of\\nimplant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearing\\nnerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specific\\nsounds.\\nDespite the benefits that the implant appears to offer,\\nsome hearing specialists and members of the deaf com-\\nmunity still believe that the benefits may not outweigh\\nthe risks and limitations of the device. Because the\\ndevice must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur-\\ngical risk. Also, manufacturers can’t promise how well a\\nperson will hear with an implant. Moreover, after getting\\nan implant, some people say they feel alienated from the\\nDeaf community, while at the same time not feeling fully\\na part of the hearing world.\\nThe sounds heard through an implant are different\\nfrom the normal hearing sounds, and have been\\ndescribed as artificial or “robotlike.” This is because the\\nimplant’s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match the\\ncomplexity of a person’s 15,000 hair cells.\\nSurgical procedure\\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision\\nbehind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge on\\nthe skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. The\\nsurgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone,\\nand gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This\\noperation takes between one and one-half to five hours.\\nPreparation\\nBefore a person gets an implant, specialists at an\\nimplant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including\\nextensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi-\\ndate can hear.\\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will\\nbenefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per-\\nson becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf-\\nness, the better the person is likely to understand speech\\nwith an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearing\\nnerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve.\\nFirst, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear-\\ning aid. If the aid can’t improve hearing enough, a physi-\\ncian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan of\\nthe inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren’t\\ngood candidates). A doctor may also order a psychological\\nexam to better understand the person’s expectations.\\nPatients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic\\nunderstanding of what an implant can and cannot do.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient remains in the hospital for a day or two\\nafter the surgery.

(Maladaptive behav-\\nior is behavior that is counter-productive or interferes\\nwith everyday living.) The treatment focuses on chang-\\ning an individual’s thoughts (cognitive patterns) in order\\nto change his or her behavior and emotional state.\\nPurpose\\nTheoretically, cognitive-behavioral therapy can be\\nemployed in any situation in which there is a pattern of\\nunwanted behavior accompanied by distress and impair-\\nment. It is a recommended treatment option for a number\\nof mental disorders, including affective (mood) disor-\\nders,personality disorders , social phobia, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, substance\\nabuse, anxiety or panic disorder , agoraphobia , post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-\\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also fre-\\nquently used as a tool to deal with chronic pain for\\npatients with illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis ,\\nback problems, and cancer. Patients with sleep disor-\\nders may also find cognitive-behavioral therapy a useful\\ntreatment for insomnia.\\nPrecautions\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable for\\nsome patients. Those who don’t have a specific behav-\\nioral issue they wish to address and whose goals for ther-\\napy are to gain insight into the past may be better served\\nby psychodynamic therapy. Patients must also be willing\\nto take a very active role in the treatment process.\\nCognitive-behavioral intervention may be inappro-\\npriate for some severely psychotic patients and for cogni-\\ntively impaired patients (for example, patients with\\norganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury),\\ndepending on their level of functioning.\\nDescription\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy combines the individ-\\nual goals of cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.\\nPioneered by psychologists Aaron Beck and Albert\\nEllis in the 1960s, cognitive therapy assumes that mal-\\nadaptive behaviors and disturbed mood or emotions are\\nthe result of inappropriate or irrational thinking patterns,\\ncalled automatic thoughts. Instead of reacting to the real-\\nity of a situation, an individual reacts to his or her own\\ndistorted viewpoint of the situation. For example, a per-\\nson may conclude that he is “worthless” simply because\\nhe failed an exam or didn’t get a date. Cognitive thera-\\npists attempt to make their patients aware of these dis-\\ntorted thinking patterns, or cognitive distortions, and\\nchange them (a process termed cognitive restructuring).\\nBehavioral therapy, or behavior modification, trains\\nindividuals to replace undesirable behaviors with healthi-\\ner behavioral patterns. Unlike psychodynamic therapies,\\nit does not focus on uncovering or understanding the\\nunconscious motivations that may be behind the maladap-\\ntive behavior. In other words, strictly behavioral therapists\\ndon’t try to find out why their patients behave the way\\nthey do, they just teach them to change the behavior.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy integrates the cogni-\\ntive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy with the\\nbehavioral modification techniques of behavioral thera-\\npy. The therapist works with the patient to identify both\\nthe thoughts and the behaviors that are causing distress,\\nand to change those thoughts in order to readjust the\\nbehavior. In some cases, the patient may have certain\\nfundamental core beliefs, called schemas, which are\\nflawed and require modification. For example, a patient\\nsuffering from depression may be avoiding social contact\\nwith others, and suffering considerable emotional dis-\\ntress because of his isolation. When questioned why, the\\npatient reveals to his therapist that he is afraid of rejec-\\ntion, of what others may do or say to him. Upon further\\nexploration with his therapist, they discover that his real\\nfear is not rejection, but the belief that he is hopelessly\\nuninteresting and unlovable. His therapist then tests the\\nreality of that assertion by having the patient name\\nfriends and family who love him and enjoy his company.\\nBy showing the patient that others value him, the thera-\\npist both exposes the irrationality of the patient’s belief\\nand provides him with a new model of thought to change\\nhis old behavior pattern. In this case, the person learns to\\nthink, “I am an interesting and lovable person; therefore I\\nshould not have difficulty making new friends in social\\nsituations.” If enough “irrational cognitions” are\\nchanged, this patient may experience considerable relief\\nfrom his depression.\\nA number of different techniques may be employed\\nin cognitive-behavioral therapy to help patients uncover\\nand examine their thoughts and change their behaviors.\\nThey include:\\n• Behavioral homework assignments. Cognitive-behav-\\nioral therapists frequently request that their patients\\ncomplete homework assignments between therapy ses-\\nsions. These may consist of real-life “behavioral exper-\\niments” where patients are encouraged to try out new\\nresponses to situations discussed in therapy sessions.\\n• Cognitive rehearsal. The patient imagines a difficult sit-\\nuation and the therapist guides him through the step-by-\\nstep process of facing and successfully dealing with it.\\nThe patient then works on practicing, or rehearsing,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n840\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy'),\n",

Ideally, when the situation arises\\nin real life, the patient will draw on the rehearsed\\nbehavior to address it.\\n• Journal. Patients are asked to keep a detailed diary\\nrecounting their thoughts, feelings, and actions when\\nspecific situations arise. The journal helps to make the\\npatient aware of his or her maladaptive thoughts and to\\nshow their consequences on behavior. In later stages of\\ntherapy, it may serve to demonstrate and reinforce posi-\\ntive behaviors.\\n• Modeling. The therapist and patient engage in role-\\nplaying exercises in which the therapist acts out appro-\\npriate behaviors or responses to situations.\\n• Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to\\nencourage a particular behavior. For example, a child\\nwith ADHD gets a gold star every time he stays focused\\non tasks and accomplishes certain daily chores. The\\ngold star reinforces and increases the desired behavior\\nby identifying it with something positive. Reinforce-\\nment can also be used to extinguish unwanted behav-\\niors by imposing negative consequences.\\n• Systematic desensitization. Patients imagine a situation\\nthey fear, while the therapist employs techniques to help\\nthe patient relax, helping the person cope with their fear\\nreaction and eventually eliminate the anxiety altogether.\\nFor example, a patient in treatment for agoraphobia, or\\nfear of open or public places, will relax and then picture\\nherself on the sidewalk outside of her house. In her next\\nsession, she may relax herself and then imagine a visit to\\na crowded shopping mall. The imagery of the anxiety-\\nproducing situations gets progressively more intense\\nuntil, eventually, the therapist and patient approach the\\nanxiety-causing situation in real-life (a “graded expo-\\nsure”), perhaps by visiting a mall. Exposure may be\\nincreased to the point of “flooding,” providing maximum\\nexposure to the real situation.

REBT is based on\\nthe belief that a person’s past experiences shape their\\nbelief system and thinking patterns. People form illogi-\\ncal, irrational thinking patterns that become the cause of\\nboth their negative emotions and of further irrational\\nideas. REBT focuses on helping patients discover these\\nirrational beliefs that guide their behavior and replace\\nthem with rational beliefs and thoughts in order to relieve\\ntheir emotional distress.\\nThere are 10 basic irrational assumptions that trigger\\nmaladaptive emotions and behaviors:\\n• It is a necessity for an adult to be loved and approved of\\nby almost everyone for virtually everything.\\n• A person must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and\\nsuccessful in all respects.\\n• Certain people are bad, wicked, or villainous and\\nshould be punished for their sins.\\n• It is catastrophic when things are not going the way one\\nwould like.\\n• Human unhappiness is externally caused. People have\\nlittle or no ability to control their sorrows or to rid\\nthemselves of negative feelings.\\n• It is right to be terribly preoccupied with and upset\\nabout something that may be dangerous or fearsome.\\n• It is easier to avoid facing many of life’s difficulties and\\nresponsibilities than it is to undertake more rewarding\\nforms of self-discipline.\\n• The past is all-important. Because something once\\nstrongly affected someone’s life, it should continue to\\ndo so indefinitely.\\n• People and things should be different from the way they\\nare. It is catastrophic if perfect solutions to the grim\\nrealities of life are not immediately found.\\n• Maximal human happiness can be achieved by inertia\\nand inaction or by passively and without commitment.\\nMeichenbaum’s self-instructional approach\\nPsychologist Donald Meichenbaum pioneered the\\nself-instructional, or “self-talk,” approach to cognitive-\\nbehavioral therapy in the 1970s. This approach focuses\\non changing what people say to themselves, both inter-\\nnally and out loud. It is based on the belief that an indi-\\nvidual’s actions follow directly from this self-talk. This\\ntype of therapy emphasizes teaching patients coping\\nskills that they can use in a variety of situations to help\\nthemselves. The technique used to accomplish this is\\nself-instructional inner dialogue, a method of talking\\nthrough a problem or situation as it occurs.\\nPreparation\\nPatients may seek therapy independently, or be\\nreferred for treatment by a primary physician, psycholo-\\ngist, or psychiatrist. Because the patient and therapist\\nwork closely together to achieve specific therapeutic\\nobjectives, it is important that their working relationship\\nis comfortable and their goals are compatible. Prior to\\nbeginning treatment, the patient and therapist should\\nmeet for a consultation session, or mutual interview. The\\nconsultation gives the therapist the opportunity to make\\nan initial assessment of the patient and recommend a\\ncourse of treatment and goals for therapy. It also gives\\nthe patient an opportunity to find out important details\\nabout the therapist’s approach to treatment, professional\\ncredentials, and any other issues of interest.\\nIn some managed-care clinical settings, an intake\\ninterview or evaluation is required before a patient\\nbegins therapy. The intake interview is used to evaluate\\nthe patient and assign him or her to a therapist. It may be\\nconducted by a psychiatric nurse, counselor, or social\\nworker.\\nNormal results\\nMany patients who undergo cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy successfully learn how to replace their mal-\\nadaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive ones that\\nfacilitate individual growth and happiness. Cognitive-\\nbehavioral therapy may be used in conjunction with\\npharmaceutical and other treatment interventions, so\\noverall success rates are difficult to gauge. However,\\nsuccess rates of 65% or more have been reported with\\ncognitive-behavioral therapy alone as a treatment for\\npanic attacks and agoraphobia. Relapse has been report-\\ned in some patient populations, perhaps due to the brief\\nnature of the therapy, but follow-up sessions can put\\npatients back on track.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGreenberger, Dennis, and Christine Padesky.

Antibodies are proteins produced by\\nthe immune system in response to specific disease\\nagents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the body pro-\\nduces against one of its own substances. Cold agglutinins\\nare autoantibodies that cause red blood cells to clump,\\nbut only when the blood is cooled below the normal body\\ntemperature of 98.6°F (37°C). The clumping is most pro-\\nnounced at temperatures below 78°F (25.6°C).\\nPurpose\\nThe cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the diag-\\nnosis of certain diseases that stimulate the body to pro-\\nduce cold agglutinins. The disease most commonly diag-\\nnosed by this test is mycoplasmal pneumonia ,b u t\\nmononucleosis, mumps, measles , scarlet fever , some\\nparasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some\\ntypes of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation\\nof cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions in\\nwhich the blood is low in oxygen because the red blood\\ncells are breaking down at a faster rate than their normal\\nlife expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these illness-\\nes, some people have a benign condition called chronic\\ncold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to cold causes\\ntemporary clumping of red blood cells and consequent\\nnumbness in ears, fingers, and toes.\\nDescription\\nSince cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to\\nclump only at temperatures lower than 98.6°F (37°C),\\nthe test consists of chilling a sample of the patient’s\\nblood. There is a bedside version of the test in which the\\ndoctor collects four or five drops of blood in a small tube,\\nKEY TERMS\\nAgglutinin —An antibody that causes red blood\\ncells to stick or clump together.\\nAntibody—A protein molecule produced by the\\nimmune system that is specific to a disease agent,\\nsuch as Mycoplasma pneumoniae . The antibody\\ncombines with the organism and disables it.\\nAutoantibody—An antibody produced by the\\nbody in reaction to any of its own cells or cell\\nproducts.\\nCold agglutinins—Antibodies that cause clumping\\nof red blood cells when the blood temperature falls\\nbelow normal body temperature (98.6°F/37°C).\\nHemolytic anemia—Oxygen deficiency in the\\nblood, caused by shortened survival of red blood\\ncells.\\nMycoplasma—A type of free-living microorganism\\nthat has no cell wall. Mycoplasmas cause some\\nvarieties of pneumonia and urinary tract infections\\nthat stimulate the body to produce cold agglutinins.\\nTiter—The concentration of a substance in a given\\nsample of blood or other tissue fluid.\\ncools the tube in ice water for 30–60 seconds, and looks\\nfor clumping of red blood cells. If the cells clump after\\nchilling and unclump as they rewarm, a cold agglutinin\\ntiter (concentration) greater than 1:64 is present. Bedside\\ntest results, however, should be confirmed by a laborato-\\nry. The laboratory test measures the clumping of red\\nblood cells in different dilutions of the patient’s blood\\nserum at 39.2°F (4°C).\\nNormal results\\nThe results of the cold agglutinins test require a doc-\\ntor’s interpretation. In general, however, a normal value\\nis lower than 1:32.\\nAbnormal results\\nAny value higher than 1:32 suggests a diagnosis of\\nmycoplasmal pneumonia or one of the other viral infec-\\ntions or disease conditions indicated by this test.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDabrow, Michael B., and Thomas G.

Cold sores are caused by a\\nherpes simplex virus infection.\\nDescription\\nA cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is\\nusually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold sore\\nare fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi-\\nalis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur on\\nthe lips which distinguishes them from the common\\ncanker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Cold\\nsores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur-\\ning the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either\\non the tongue or inside the cheeks.\\nCold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are\\neight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two\\nof these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause cold\\nsores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus\\ntype 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virus\\ntype 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely\\ntrue. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her-\\npes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold\\nsores are almost always type 1.\\nOral herpes is very common. More than 60% of\\nAmericans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of\\nthose infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of\\nthese persons became infected before age 10. Anyone\\ncan become infected by herpes virus and, once infected,\\nthe virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses are\\nspread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con-\\ntact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the time\\nperiod beginning with the appearance of blisters and end-\\ning with scab formation. However, infected persons need\\nnot have visible blisters to spread the infection to others\\nsince the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi-\\nous oral lesions.\\nViruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria\\nare independent and can reproduce on their own, viruses\\nenter human cells and force them to make more virus. The\\ninfected human cell is usually killed and releases thou-\\nsands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue\\ndamage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her-\\npes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cell\\nproduce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits.\\nThe herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is\\ncalled “latency.” A latent virus can wait inside the nervous\\nsystem for days, months, or even years. At some future\\ntime, the virus “awakens” and causes the cell to produce\\nthousands of new viruses that cause an active infection.\\nThis process of latency and active infection is best\\nunderstood by considering the cold sore cycle. An active\\ninfection is obvious because cold sores are present. The\\nfirst infection is called the “primary” infection. This active\\ninfection is then controlled by the body’s immune system\\nand the sores heal. In between active infections, the virus\\nis latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses become\\nactivated and once again cause sores. These are called\\n“recurrent” infections. Although it is unknown what trig-\\ngers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem to\\nbring on infections. These include stress, illness, tired-\\nness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not\\neveryone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of\\nherpes occur within two-20 days after contact with an\\ninfected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are\\nusually more severe than those of recurrent infections.\\nThe primary infection can cause symptoms like other\\nviral infections including tiredness,headache, fever, and\\nswollen lymph nodes in the neck.\\nTypically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe-\\nrience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of\\npain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site where blis-\\nters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywhere\\nfrom a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec-\\ntion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection and\\nrecurrent infections.\\nIn 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters\\noccur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the\\n“vermilion border.” Less often, blisters form on the nose,\\nchin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease\\nprocess is rapid. First, small red bumps appear that\\nquickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters\\nmay either burst and form a scab or dry up and form a\\nscab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis-\\nters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and\\nwithout scarring within six to ten days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n844\\nCold sore'),\n",

These painful sores may last up\\nto three weeks and can make eating and drinking diffi-\\ncult. Because of this, young children with gingivostom-\\natitis are at risk for dehydration (excessive loss of water\\nfrom the body).\\nMost people experience fewer than two recurrent\\noutbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people never\\nexperience outbreaks, while some have very frequent\\noutbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the same\\narea each time and are triggered by the same factors\\n(such as stress, sun exposure, etc).\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed\\nprimarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treated\\nby the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who spe-\\ncialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease special-\\nists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for the\\nvirus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, a\\nsample from an open sore would be taken for viral cul-\\nture. A sterile cotton swab would be wiped over open\\nsores and the sample used to infect human cells in cul-\\nture. Cells that are killed by the herpes virus have a cer-\\ntain appearance under microscopic examination. The\\nresults of this test are available within two to 10 days.\\nOral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection called\\nimpetigo. This skin infection is most commonly seen in\\nchildren and causes herpes-like blisters around the mouth\\nand nose. Also, because oral herpes can occur inside the\\nmouth, the blisters could be mistaken for common canker\\nsores. Therefore, the doctor would need to determine\\nwhether the blisters are oral herpes, canker sores, or\\nimpetigo. The diagnosis and treatment of herpes infec-\\ntions should be covered by most insurance providers.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There\\nare antiviral drugs available that have some effect on\\nlessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-\\npes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-\\nvent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work by\\ninterfering with the replication of the viruses, and are\\nmost effective when taken as early in the infection\\nprocess as possible. For the best results, drug treatment\\nshould begin during the prodrome stage before blisters\\nare visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak,\\ndrug treatment could continue for up to 10 days.\\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes\\ninfection and can be given intravenously or taken by\\nmouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment\\nbut is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for chil-\\ndren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treating\\nboth the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks.\\nWhen taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir\\nreduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.\\nDuring an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus\\nfoods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores\\nshould be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day\\nwith warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-\\ncounter lip products that contain the chemical phenol\\n(such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing\\nointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage\\nmay be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent\\nspreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face.\\nAcetaminophen(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\\nmay be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.\\nAlternative treatment\\nVitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have\\nan effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores.

These practices are:\\n• Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting\\nprolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to the\\nface and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with a\\nlarge brim is also helpful.\\n• Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or\\npinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to other\\nparts of the lips or face and infect those sites.\\n• Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should\\nwash their hands carefully before touching others. An\\ninfected person can spread the virus to others even\\nwhen he or she has no obvious blisters.\\n• Avoid contact with others during active infection.\\nInfected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact\\nwith others until after the cold sores have healed.\\n• Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s sore.\\n• Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes\\nor lips of a baby who is under six months old.\\n• Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected\\nchildren to share toys that may be put into the mouth.\\nToys that have been mouthed should be disinfected\\nbefore other children play with them.\\n• Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of\\nsleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get-\\nting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on cold\\nsores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys-\\ntem strong; this helps to keep the virus in check and\\nprevents outbreaks.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGorbach, Sherman, John Bartlett, and Neil Blacklow, eds.\\nInfectious Diseases.

It is more common in boys than in girls and most\\ncommon in a family’s first child. Symptoms of colic usu-\\nally appear when a baby is 14–21 days old, reach a\\ncrescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with-\\nin the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently but\\nintermittently and usually begin with prolonged periods\\nof crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can last\\nfor just a few minutes or continue for several hours.\\nSome babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cry\\nso hard that their faces turn red, then pale.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNo one knows what causes colic. The condition may\\nbe the result of swallowing large amounts of air, which\\nbecomes trapped in the digestive tract and causes bloat-\\ning and severe abdominal pain.\\nOther possible causes of colic include:\\n• digestive tract immaturity\\n• food intolerances\\n• hunger or overfeeding\\n• lack of sleep\\n• loneliness\\n• overheated milk or formula\\n• overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity\\n• tension\\nDuring a colicky episode, babies’ bellies often look\\nswollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Crying\\nintensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babies\\ngrow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and draw\\ntheir legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move-\\nment can end an attack. Most babies who have colic\\ndon’t seem to be in pain between attacks.\\nDiagnosis\\nPediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in\\nan infant who:\\n• has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least\\nthree times a week for three weeks or longer\\n• is not hungry but cries for several hours between din-\\nnertime and midnight\\n• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other\\nphysical traits associated with colic\\nThe baby’s medical history and a parent’s descrip-\\ntion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to\\nconfirm a diagnosis of colic.

Malignant cells have lost normal control mech-\\nanisms governing growth. These cells may invade sur-\\nrounding local tissue, or they may spread throughout the\\nbody and invade other organ systems.\\nSynonyms for the colon include the large bowel or\\nthe large intestine. The rectum is the continuation of the\\nlarge intestine into the pelvis that terminates in the anus.\\nDescription\\nThe colon is a tubular organ beginning in the right\\nlower aspect of the abdomen. Anatomically, it ascends on\\nthe right side of the abdomen, traverses from right to left\\nin the upper abdomen, descends vertically down the left\\nside, takes an S-shaped curve in the lower left abdomen,\\nand then flows into the rectum as it leaves the abdomen\\nfor the pelvis. These portions of the colon are named sep-\\narately though they are part of the same organ:\\n• cecum, the beginning of the colon\\n• ascending colon, the right vertical ascent of the colon\\n• transverse colon, the portion traversing from right to left\\n• descending colon, the left vertical descent of the colon\\n• sigmoid colon, the s-shaped segment of colon above the\\npelvis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2848\\nColon cancer'),\n",

Lymph\\nnodes are small filters through which the lymph travels\\non its way back to the blood stream. Cancer can spread\\nelsewhere in the body by invading the lymph and vascu-\\nlar systems. Therefore, these anatomic considerations\\nbecome very important in the treatment of colon cancer.\\nThe small intestine is the continuation of the upper\\ngastrointestinal tract that is responsible for the transport\\nof ingested nutrients into the body. The waste left after\\nthe small intestine has completed absorption of nutrients\\namounts to a few liters (about the same as quart) of mate-\\nrial per day and is directly delivered to the colon (at the\\ncecum) for processing. Physiologically, the colon is\\nresponsible for the preservation of fluid and electrolytes\\nas it propels the increasingly solid waste towards the rec-\\ntum and anus for excretion.\\nWhen cells lining the colon become malignant, they\\nfirst grow locally and may invade partially or totally\\nthrough the wall of the bowel and even into adjacent\\nstructures and organs. In the process, the tumor can pene-\\ntrate and invade the lymphatics or the capillaries locally\\nand it gains access to the circulation. As the malignant\\ncells work their way to other areas of the body, they\\nagain become locally invasive in the new area to which\\nthey have spread. These tumor deposits, originating in\\nthe colon primary tumor, are then known as metastases.\\nIf metastases are found in the regional lymph nodes from\\nthe primary, they are known as regional metastases or\\nregional nodal metastases. If they are distant from the\\nprimary tumor, they are known as distant metastases. The\\npatient with distant metastases has systemic disease.\\nThus the cancer originating in the colon begins locally\\nand, given time, can become systemic in its extent.\\nBy the time the primary is originally detected, it is\\nusually larger than 0.4 in (1 cm) in size and has over a\\nmillion cells. This amount of growth itself is estimated to\\ntake about three to seven years. Each time the cells dou-\\nble in number, the size of the tumor quadruples. Thus,\\nlike most cancers, the part that is identified clinically is\\nlater in the progression than would be desired and\\nscreening becomes a very important endeavor to aid in\\nearlier detection of this disease.\\nThere are about 94,000 cases of colon cancer diag-\\nnosed per year in the United States. Together, colon and\\nrectal cancers account for 10% of cancers in men and\\n11% of cancers in women. It is the second most com-\\nmon site-specific cancer affecting both men and\\nwomen. (Lung cancer is the first affecting both men and\\nwomen, breast is the leader in women and prostate the\\nleader in men.) Nearly 48,000 people died from colon\\ncancer in the United States in 2000. In recent years the\\nincidence of this disease is decreasing very slightly, as\\nhas the mortality rate. It is difficult to tell if the\\ndecrease in mortality reflects earlier diagnosis, less\\ndeathrelated to the actual treatment of the disease, or a\\ncombination of both factors.\\nCancer of the colon is thought to arise sporadically\\nin about 80% of those who develop the disease. Twenty\\npercent of cases are thought to have genetic predisposi-\\ntion that ranges from familial syndromes affecting 50%\\nof the offspring of a mutation carrier, to a risk of 6%\\nwhen there is just a family history of colon cancer occur-\\nring in a first degree relative. Development of colon can-\\ncer at an early age, or at multiple sites, or recurrent colon\\ncancer suggests a genetically transmitted form of the dis-\\nease as opposed to the sporadic form.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of colon cancer are probably environmental\\nin the sporadic cases (80%) and genetic in the heredity\\npredisposed cases (20%). Since malignant cells have a\\nchanged genetic makeup, this means that in 80% of\\ncases, the environment spontaneously induces change,\\nwhereas in those born with a genetic predisposition, they\\nare either destined to get the cancer or it will take less\\nenvironmental exposure to induce the cancer. Exposure\\nto agents in the environment that may induce mutation is\\nthe process of carcinogenesis and is caused by agents\\nknown as carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Specific\\ncarcinogens have been difficult to identify; however,\\ndietary factors seem to be involved.\\nColon cancer is more common in industrialized\\nnations and diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and\\nalcohol seem to predispose. Diets high in fiber are asso-\\nciated with a decreased risk. The mechanism for protec-\\ntion by high-fiber diets may be related to less exposure of\\nthe colon lining to carcinogens from the environment, as\\nthe transit time through the bowel is faster with a high-\\nfiber diet than it is with a low-fiber diet.\\nAge plays a definite role in the predisposition to\\ncolon cancer. Colon cancer is uncommon before age 40.\\nThis incidence increases substantially after age 50 and\\ndoubles with each succeeding decade.\\nThere is also a slight increase risk for colon cancer\\nin the individual who smokes.\\nPatients who suffer from inflammatory diseases of\\nthe colon known as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis\\nare also at increased risk.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n849\\nColon cancer'),\n",

There are\\nmultiple different mutations that occur at this site, yet\\nthey all cause a defect in tumor suppression that results\\nin early and frequent development of colon cancer. This\\ngenetic aberration is transmitted to 50% of offspring and\\neach of those affected will develop colon cancer, usually\\nat an early age. There is another syndrome, hereditary\\nnon-polyposis colon cancer (also known as Lynch syn-\\ndrome), related to mutations in any of four genes respon-\\nsible for DNA mismatch repair. In patients with colon\\ncancer, the p53 gene is mutated 70% of the time. When\\nthe p53 gene is mutated and ineffective, cells with dam-\\naged DNA escape repair or destruction. This allows for\\nthe damaged cell to perpetuate itself, and continued\\nreplication of the damaged DNA may lead to tumor\\ndevelopment. Though these syndromes have a very high\\nincidence of colon cancer, family history without the\\nsyndrome is also a substantial risk factor. When consid-\\nering first-degree relatives, history of one with colon can-\\ncer raises the baseline risk of 2% to 6%. (Most physi-\\ncians think that this baseline is about 4%.) The presence\\nof a second raises the risk to 17%.\\nThe development of polyps of the colon almost\\nalways precedes the development of colon cancer by five\\nor more years. Polyps are benign growths of the colon\\nlining. They can be unrelated to cancer, precancerous, or\\nmalignant. Polyps, when identified, are removed for\\ndiagnosis. If the polyps are benign, the patient should\\nundergo careful surveillance for the development of\\nmore polyps or the development of colon cancer.\\nColon cancer causes symptoms related to its local\\npresence in the large bowel or by its effect on other\\norgans if it has spread. These symptoms may occur alone\\nor in combination:\\n• a change in bowel habit\\n• blood in the stool\\n• bloating, persistent abdominal distention\\n• constipation\\n• a feeling of fullness even after having a bowel move-\\nment\\n• narrowing of the stool—so-called ribbon stools\\n• persistent, chronic fatigue\\n• abdominal discomfort\\n• unexplained weight loss\\n• very rarely, nausea and vomiting\\nMost of these symptoms are caused by the physical\\npresence of the tumor mass in the colon. Similar symp-\\ntoms can be caused by other processes; these are not\\nabsolutely specific to colon cancer. The key is recogniz-\\ning that the persistence of these types of symptoms with-\\nout ready explanation should prompt the individual to\\nseek medical evaluation.\\nMany of the symptoms are understood by remem-\\nbering that the colon is a tubular conduit. If a tumor\\ndevelops, as it reaches a certain size it will begin to cause\\nsymptoms related to the obstruction of that conduit. In\\naddition, the tumor commonly oozes blood that is lost in\\nthe stool. (Often, this blood is not visible.) This phenom-\\nenon results in anemia and chronic fatigue. Weight loss is\\na late symptom, often implying substantial obstruction or\\nthe presence of systemic disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nScreening\\nOf all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer\\ncan be prevented by screening. In all other cancers (breast\\nand prostate, for example), screening tests look for small,\\nmalignant lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, how-\\never, is the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. This\\nscreening can be close to 100% effective in preventing\\ncancer development, not just in detecting small cancers.\\nScreening involves physical exam, simple laboratory\\ntests, and the visualization of the lining of the colon. The\\nways to visualize the colon epithelium are with x rays (indi-\\nrect visualization), and endoscopy (direct visualization).\\nThe physical examination involves the perfor-\\nmance of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includes\\nmanual examination of the rectum, anus, and the\\nprostate. During this examination, the physician exam-\\nines the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids,\\nabscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating the\\ngloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides the\\nfinger into the anus and follows the contours of the rec-\\ntum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and feels\\nthe walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and mass-\\nes as far as the examining finger can reach. At the time of\\nthis exam, the physician checks the stool on the examin-\\ning glove with a chemical to see if any occult (invisible),\\nblood is present. At home, after having a bowel move-\\nment, the patient is asked to swipe a sample of stool\\nobtained with a small stick on a card. After 3 such speci-\\nmens are on the card, the card is then easily chemically\\ntested for occult blood also. (The stool analysis men-\\ntioned here is known as a fecal occult blood test ,o r\\nFOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not 100% accu-\\nrate—only about 50% of cancers are FOBT-positive.)\\nThese exams are accomplished as an easy part of a rou-\\ntine yearly physical exam.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n850\\nColon cancer'),\n",

Therefore, screening by chemical analysis\\nfor CEA has not been helpful. CEA has been helpful\\nwhen used in a follow-up role for patients treated for\\ncolon cancer if their tumor makes the protein.\\nIndirect visualization of the colon may be accom-\\nplished by placing barium through the rectum and filling the\\ncolon with this compound. Barium produces a white con-\\ntrast image of the lining of the colon on x ray and thus, the\\ncontour of the lining of the colon may be seen. Detail can be\\nincreased if the barium utilized is thinned and air also intro-\\nduced. These studies are known as the barium enema(BE)\\nand the double contrast barium enema (DCBE).\\nDirect visualization of the lining of the colon is\\naccomplished using a scope or endoscope. The physician\\nintroduces the instrument through the rectum and passes\\nit proximally, visualizing the colon epithelium in the\\nprocess. Older, shorter scopes were rigid. Today, utiliz-\\ning fiberoptic technology, the scopes are flexible and can\\nreach much farther. If the left colon only is visualized, it\\nis called flexible sigmoidoscopy.

The combination of a flexible sigmoidoscopy and\\nDCBE may be performed but the preferred evaluation of\\nthe entire colon and rectum is that of complete\\ncolonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,\\nphotography, and the opportunity to obtain a biopsy of\\nany abnormality visualized. If, for technical reasons, the\\nentire colon is not visualized endoscopically, a DCBE\\nshould complement the colonoscopy.\\nThe diagnosis of colon cancer is actually made by\\nthe performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion in\\nthe colon. When a tumor growth is identified, it could be\\neither a benign polyp (or lesion) or a cancer; the biopsy\\nresolves the issue. The endoscopist may take many sam-\\nples so as to exclude any sampling errors.\\nIf the patient presents with advanced disease, or has\\nadvanced disease at the time of diagnosis, areas where\\nthe tumor has spread (such as the liver) may be amenable\\nto biopsy.

However, this\\ncircumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% of\\nall colon cancer cases.\\nAfter the resection is completed, the ends of the\\nremaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is called\\nan anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be a\\nslight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. This\\neffect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patients\\ngo on to develop completely normal bowel function.\\nOccasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and\\ncannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs when\\nthe bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer-\\ngency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When the\\nanastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per-\\nformed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing the\\nend of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing it\\nto the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (a\\nbag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo-\\nrary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, safer\\ndate, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases,\\nemergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation therapyis used as an adjunct to surgery\\nif there is concern about potential for local recurrence\\npost-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate the\\nradiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle of\\nthe abdominal wall but was not completely removed, this\\narea would be considered for radiation. Radiation has\\nsignificant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed to\\nit because the small and large intestine do not tolerate\\nradiation well.\\nRadiation is also used in the treatment of patients\\nwho present with or progress to having metastatic dis-\\nease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastatic\\ncolon cancer to the brain.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapyis useful for patients who have had\\nall identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur-\\nrence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may also\\nbe used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond the\\nscope of regional therapy, but this use is rare.\\nAdjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease\\nwith deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standard\\ntherapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined\\nwith leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU is\\nan antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the response\\nrate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancer\\nin response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev-\\namisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system),\\nmay be substituted for leucovorin. These protocols\\nreduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor-\\ntality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity,\\nbut usually are tolerated fairly well.\\nSimilar chemotherapy may be administered for stage\\nIV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas-\\ntases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu-\\nnately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease,\\nand this chemotherapy may not prolong survival or\\nimprove quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trials\\nhave now shown that the results can be improved with the\\naddition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan does\\nnot seem to increase toxicity but it improved response rates\\nto 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival,\\nand prolonged overall survival by a little over two months.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies have not been studied in a\\nlarge-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins ,\\nfiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoiding\\ncigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiating\\nany alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consult\\nhis/her physician to be sure that these therapies do not\\ncomplicate or interfere with the established therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after\\ntherapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for colon\\ncancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival rates\\nare dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time of\\ndiagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhile\\nendeavor.\\nAbout 15% of patients present with stage I disease\\nand 85–90% survive.

McCartney, MD\\nColon therapy see Colonic irrigation\\nColonic irrigation\\nDefinition\\nColonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of\\nthe colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. It\\nis the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal-\\nlons of water through it with the use of special equipment.\\nIt is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not just\\nthe lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact-\\ned fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites that\\noften build up over the passage of time. It is a procedure\\nthat should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.\\nPurpose\\nAnyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping\\npains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list\\nof bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable\\nbowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-\\nular,cancer patients are often advised to undertake a\\ncourse of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part\\nof their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy\\nbegins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous\\nmass, it is essential that speedy and effective elimination\\nof the resulting toxins is achieved.\\nColon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes\\nof death in the United States, and alternative practitioners\\ninsist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce-\\ndures. Providing that care is taken to replace the natural\\norganisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefits\\ncan be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter-\\nnative practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowel\\nis the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it clean\\nwill be an effective protection against this.\\nRemoving large amounts of toxic matter relieves the\\npatient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms such\\nas arthritis,chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis, and\\na host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga-\\ntion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug-\\ngish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapy\\ntreatments over time. In addition, removing the layer of\\nfecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu-\\nals allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from\\nfoods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and other\\nnutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition-\\ners consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to\\nbe essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nCleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is\\nnot a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have been\\nused successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicity\\nand even acute cases of toxemia.\\nOver time, many people develop a thick layer of\\nfecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens and\\nbecomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the bowel,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n854\\nColonic irrigation'),\n",

The\\namount of water will vary but will generally be in the\\nregion of between two and six liters (or quarts) at any\\none time. This triggers peristaltic action and the patient\\nwill begin to expel the water along with fecal matter back\\nthrough the tube and into the machine.\\nThe fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing\\ntube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored.

It is important\\nthat the right amount of water is used, as too much will\\ncause discomfort and too little will be ineffective. If cor-\\nrectly done, colonic irrigation is not painful at all and some\\npatients claim to sleep through their treatment.\\nSanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and\\nspeculums used are generally disposable, but other parts\\nof the machine, such as the viewing tube, must be steril-\\nized after each patient.\\nNormally, a series of treatments will be required to\\nachieve desired results regarding the elimination of\\nimpacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel reg-\\nularity.

The difficulties can be mild to severe. It\\nis a misleading term because people with color blindness\\nare not blind. Rather, they tend to see colors in a limited\\nrange of hues; a rare few may not see colors at all.\\nDescription\\nNormal color vision requires the use of specialized\\nreceptor cells called cones, which are located in the reti-\\nna of the eye. There are three types of cones, termed red,\\nblue, and green, which enable people to see a wide spec-\\ntrum of colors. An abnormality, or deficiency, of any of\\nthe types of cones will result in abnormal color vision.\\nThere are three basic variants of color blindness.\\nRed/green color blindness (deuteranopia) is the most\\ncommon deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian males\\nand 0.5% of Caucasian females. The prevalence varies\\nwith culture.\\nBlue color blindness (protanopia) is an inability to\\ndistinguish both blue and yellow, which are seen as white\\nor gray. Protanopia is quite rare and has equal prevalence\\nin males and females. It is common for young children to\\nhave blue/green confusion that becomes less pronounced\\nin adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in peo-\\nple who have physical disorders such as liver disease or\\ndiabetes mellitus.\\nA total inability to distinguish colors (achromatop-\\nsia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals view\\nthe world in shades of gray. They frequently have poor\\nvisual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light (photo-\\nphobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.\\nResearchers studying red/green color blindness in\\nthe United Kingdom reported an average prevalence of\\nonly 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males are\\ncolor blind. Approximately 2.9% of boys from Saudi\\nArabia and 3.7% from India were found to have deficient\\ncolor vision. Red/green color blindness may slightly\\nincrease an affected person’s chances of contracting lep-\\nrosy. Pre-term infants exhibit an increased prevalence of\\nblue color blindness. Achromatopsia has a prevalence of\\nabout 1 in 33,000 in the United States and affects males\\nand females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRed/green and blue color blindness appear to be\\nlocated on at least two different gene locations. The\\nmajority of affected individuals are males. Females are\\ncarriers, but are not normally affected. This indicates that\\nthe X chromosome is one of the locations for color blind-\\nness. Male offspring of females who carry the altered\\ngene have a 50-50 chance of being color-blind. The rare\\nfemale that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still,\\nblue color blindness, indicates there is an involvement of\\nanother gene. As of 2001, the location of this gene has\\nnot been identified.\\nAchromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish\\ncolor, is an autosomal recessive disease of the retina.\\nThis means that both parents have one copy of the altered\\ngene but do not have the disease. Each of their children\\nhas a 25% chance of not having the gene, a 50% chance\\nof having one altered gene (and, like the parents, being\\nunaffected), and a 25% risk of having both the altered\\ngene and the condition. In 1997, the achromatopsia gene\\nwas located on chromosome 2.\\nThe inability to correctly identify colors is the only\\nsign of color blindness. It is important to note that people\\nwith red/green or blue varieties of color blindness use\\nother cues such as color saturation and object shape or\\nlocation to distinguish colors.

Temporary colostomies are created to divert stool\\nfrom injured or diseased portions of the large intestine,\\nallowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per-\\nformed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis-\\ntance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.\\nAlthough colorectal cancer is the most common indica-\\ntion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10–15% of\\npatients with this diagnosis require a colostomy.\\nDescription\\nSurgery will result in one of three types of colos-\\ntomies:\\n• End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine\\n(the section of bowel that remains connected to the\\nupper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur-\\nface of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the\\nintestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.\\nA stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface of\\nthe body. The surface of the stoma is actually the lining\\nof the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. The\\ndistal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec-\\ntum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in the\\nabdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanent\\nostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho-\\nlogical condition.\\n• Double–barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the\\ncreation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall.\\nThe proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end that\\nis connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will\\ndrain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectum\\nand also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts\\nof mucus material. This is most often a temporary\\ncolostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be\\nlater closed.\\n• Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing\\na loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal\\nwall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by\\na plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made in\\nthe bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loop\\ncolostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi-\\nmately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing has\\noccurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n861\\nColostomy'),\n",

Blood and urine studies, along\\nwith various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG),\\nmay be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi-\\nble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist,\\nwho will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for\\nthe stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy\\nmanagement.\\nIn order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient\\nmay be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior\\nto surgery.

A series of enemas and/or oral preparations\\n(GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel\\nof stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin,\\nor kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte-\\nria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec-\\ntion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the\\nstomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to\\nremove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom-\\niting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be\\ninserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving\\nmore space in the surgical field and decreasing chances\\nof accidental injury.\\nAftercare\\nPost-operative care for the patient with a new colos-\\ntomy, as with those who have had any major surgery,\\ninvolves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations,\\nand temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because\\nof the effect of anesthesia and the patient’s reluctance to\\nbreathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the\\nabdominal incision.

Wright, RN\\nColposcopy\\nDefinition\\nColposcopy is a procedure that allows a physician to\\ntake a closer look at a woman’s cervix and vagina using a\\nspecial instrument called a colposcope. It is used to\\ncheck for precancerous or abnormal areas. The colpo-\\nscope can magnify the area between 10 and 40 times;\\nsome devices also can take photographs.\\nPurpose\\nThe colposcope helps to identify abnormal areas of\\nthe cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue (biop-\\nsies) can be taken for further analysis.\\nColposcopy is used to identify or rule out the exis-\\ntence of any precancerous conditions in the cervical tis-\\nsue. If a PAP test shows abnormal cell growth, further\\ntesting, such as colposcopy, often is required. A PAP test\\nis a screening test that involves scraping cells from the\\noutside of the cervix. If abnormal cells are found, the\\nphysician will attempt to find the area that produced the\\nabnormal cells and remove it for further study (biopsy).\\nOnly then can a diagnosis be made.\\nColposcopy may also be performed if the cervix\\nlooks abnormal during a routine examination. It may also\\nbe suggested for women with genital warts and for\\ndiethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters (women whose moth-\\ners took DES when pregnant with them).\\nPrecautions\\nWomen who are pregnant, or who suspect that they\\nare pregnant, must tell their doctor before the procedure\\nbegins. Pregnant women can, and should, have a col-\\nposcopy if they have an abnormal PAP test. However, spe-\\ncial precautions must be taken during biopsy of the cervix.\\nDescription\\nA colposcopy is performed in a physician’s office\\nand is similar to a regular gynecologic exam. An instru-\\nment called a speculum is used to hold the vagina open,\\nand the gynecologist looks at the cervix and vagina\\nthrough the colposcope instead simply by eye, as in a\\nroutine examination.\\nThe colposcope is placed outside the patient’s body\\nand never touches the skin. The cervix and vagina are\\nswabbed with dilute acetic acid (vinegar). The solution\\nhighlights abnormal areas by turning them white (instead\\nof a normal pink color). Abnormal areas can also be\\nidentified by looking for a characteristic pattern made by\\nabnormal blood vessels.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n864\\nColposcopy'),\n",

If the abnormal\\narea appears to extend inside the cervical canal, a scrap-\\ning of the canal may be done. The biopsy results are usu-\\nally available within a week.\\nIf the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth (dys-\\nplasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal area can\\nbe seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue using one of\\nseveral procedures, including ones that use high heat\\n(diathermy), extreme cold (cryosurgery), or lasers.\\nAnother procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision\\n(LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency radio waves to\\nexcise tissue.

Turkington\\nComa\\nDefinition\\nComa, from the Greek word “koma,” meaning deep\\nsleep, is a state of extreme unresponsiveness, in which an\\nindividual exhibits no voluntary movement or behavior.\\nFurthermore, in a deep coma, even painful stimuli\\n(actions which, when performed on a healthy individual,\\nresult in reactions) are unable to affect any response, and\\nnormal reflexes may be lost.\\nDescription\\nComa lies on a spectrum with other alterations in con-\\nsciousness. The level of consciousness required by, for\\nexample, someone reading this passage lies at one extreme\\nend of the spectrum, while complete brain death lies at the\\nother end of the spectrum. In between are such states as\\nobtundation, drowsiness, and stupor. All of these are con-\\nditions which, unlike coma, still allow the individual to\\nrespond to stimuli, although such a response may be brief\\nand require stimulus of greater than normal intensity.\\nIn order to understand the loss of function suffered\\nby a comatose individual, it is necessary to first under-\\nstand the important characteristics of the conscious state.\\nConsciousness is defined by two fundamental elements:\\nawareness and arousal.\\nAwareness allows one to receive and process all the\\ninformation communicated by the five senses, and thus\\nrelate to oneself and to the outside world. Awareness has\\nboth psychological and physiological components. The\\npsychological component is governed by an individual’s\\nmind and mental processes. The physiological compo-\\nnent refers to the functioning of an individual’s brain,\\nand therefore that brain’s physical and chemical condi-\\ntion. Awareness is regulated by cortical areas within the\\ncerebral hemispheres, the outermost layer of the brain\\nthat separates humans from other animals by allowing\\nfor greater intellectual functioning.\\nArousal is regulated solely by physiological func-\\ntioning and consists of more primitive responsiveness to\\nthe world, as demonstrated by predictable reflex (invol-\\nuntary) responses to stimuli. Arousal is maintained by\\nthe reticular activating system (RAS). This is not an\\nanatomical area of the brain, but rather a network of\\nstructures (including the brainstem, the medulla, and the\\nthalamus) and nerve pathways, which function together\\nto produce and maintain arousal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nComa, then, is the result of something that interferes\\nwith the functioning of the cerebral cortex and/or the\\nfunctioning of the structures which make up the RAS.

The Glasgow Coma Scale\\nassigns a different number of points for exam results in\\nthree different categories: opening the eyes, verbal\\nresponse (using words or voice to respond), and motor\\nresponse (moving a part of the body). Fifteen is the\\nlargest possible number of total points, indicating the\\nhighest level of functioning. The highest level of func-\\ntioning would be demonstrated by an individual who\\nspontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriate\\nanswers to questions about his/her situation, and can\\ncarry out a command (such as “move your leg” or “nod\\nyour head”). Three is the least possible number of total\\npoints and would be given to a patient for whom not even\\na painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response. In\\nthe middle are those patients who may be able to\\nrespond, but who require an intense or painful stimulus,\\nand whose response may demonstrate some degree of\\nbrain malfunctioning (such as a person whose only\\nresponse to pain in a limb is to bend that limb in toward\\nthe body).

Secondary bacterial infection\\nmay lead to middle ear infection,bronchitis , pneumo-\\nnia, sinus infection, or strep throat. People with chronic\\nlung disease, asthma, diabetes, or a weakened immune\\nsystem are more likely to develop these complications.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nColds are caused by more than 200 different viruses.\\nThe most common groups are rhinoviruses and coron-\\naviruses. Different groups of viruses are more infectious\\nat different seasons of the year, but knowing the exact\\nvirus causing the cold is not important in treatment.\\nPeople with colds are contagious during the first two\\nto four days of the infection. Colds pass from person to\\nperson in several ways. When an infected person coughs,\\nsneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets containing the virus\\nare expelled. If these are breathed in by other people, the\\nvirus may establish itself in their noses and airways.\\nColds may also be passed through direct contact. If a\\nperson with a cold touches his runny nose or watery eyes,\\nthen shakes hands with another person some of the virus is\\ntransferred to the uninfected person. If that person then\\ntouches his mouth, nose, or eyes, the virus is transferred to\\nan environment where it can reproduce and cause a cold.\\nFinally, cold viruses can be spread through inani-\\nmate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that become\\ncontaminated with the virus. This is a common method\\nof transmission in child care centers. If a child with a\\ncold touches his runny nose, then plays with a toy, some\\nof the virus may be transferred to the toy. When another\\nchild plays with the toy a short time later, he may pick up\\nsome of the virus on his hands. The second child then\\ntouches his contaminated hands to his eyes, nose, or\\nmouth and transfers some of the cold virus to himself.\\nOnce acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the\\nlining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes the\\ninfected cells to release a chemical called histamine. His-\\ntamine increases the blood flow to the infected cells,\\ncausing swelling, congestion, and increased mucus pro-\\nduction. Within one to three days the infected person\\nbegins to show cold symptoms.\\nThe first cold symptoms are a tickle in the throat,\\nrunny nose, and sneezing. The initial discharge from the\\nnose is clear and thin. Later it changes to a thick yellow\\nor greenish discharge. Most adults do not develop a fever\\nwhen they catch a cold. Young children may develop a\\nlow fever of up to 102°F (38.9°C).\\nIn addition to a runny nose and fever, signs of a cold\\ninclude coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, headache,\\nmuscle ache, chills, sore throat , hoarseness, watery\\neyes, tiredness, and lack of appetite. The cough that\\naccompanies a cold is usually intermittent and dry.\\nMost people begin to feel better four to five days\\nafter their cold symptoms become noticeable. All symp-\\ntoms are generally gone within ten days, except for a dry\\ncough that may linger for up to three weeks.\\nColds make people more susceptible to bacterial\\ninfections such as strep throat, middle ear infections, and\\nsinus infections. A person whose cold does not begin to\\nimprove within a week; or who experiences chest pain,\\nfever for more than a few days, difficulty breathing,\\nbluish lips or fingernails, a cough that brings up green-\\nish-yellow or grayish sputum, skin rash, swollen glands,\\nor whitish spots on the tonsils or throat should consult a\\ndoctor to see if they have acquired a secondary bacterial\\ninfection that needs to be treated with an antibiotic.\\nPeople who have emphysema, chronic lung disease,\\ndiabetes, or a weakened immune system—either from\\ndiseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of\\nmedications, ( corticosteroids , chemotherapy drugs)—\\nshould consult their doctor if they get a cold. People with\\nthese health problems are more likely to get a secondary\\ninfection.\\nDiagnosis\\nColds are diagnosed by observing a person’s symp-\\ntoms. There are no laboratory tests readily available to\\ndetect the cold virus. However, a doctor may do a throat\\nculture or blood test to rule out a secondary infection.\\nInfluenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but flu\\ncauses much more severe symptoms and generally a\\nfever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the\\nnose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than the\\ncommon cold. An allergist can do tests to determine if\\nthe cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergic\\nreaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when they\\ngo outside in winter and breathe cold air. This type of\\nrunny nose is not a symptom of a cold.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no medicines that will cure the common\\ncold. Given time, the body’s immune system will make\\nantibodies to fight the infection, and the cold will be\\nresolved without any intervention. Antibiotics are use-\\nless against a cold. However, a great deal of money is\\nspent by pharmaceutical companies in the United States\\npromoting products designed to relieve cold symptoms.\\nThese products usually contain antihistamines , decon-\\ngestants, and/or pain relievers.\\nAntihistamines block the action of the chemical hist-\\namine that is produced when the cold virus invades the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n870\\nCommon cold'),\n",

Common variable immunodefi-\\nciency is the most common of the immunodeficiency dis-\\norders. Patients with this disease have frequent infec-\\ntions, especially those caused by the same microorgan-\\nism. Recurring infections are an indication that the\\nimmune system is not responding normally and develop-\\ning immunity to reinfection. Patients with common vari-\\nable immunodeficiency have a normal number of B cells,\\nthe lymphocytes that make antibodies. In approximately\\none-third of these patients, the number of B cells in the\\nblood that have IgG antibodies on their surface is lower\\nthan normal, but there are normal numbers of B cells in\\ntheir bone marrow. B cells with IgG antibodies on their\\nsurface are capable of responding to microorganisms.\\nThe lack of IgG on the surface of the B cells means that\\nthey are not prepared to fight infection. The T-cell lym-\\nphocytes, those cells responsible for cellular immunity,\\nare usually normal, although some cell signal compo-\\nnents may be lacking.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of common variable immunodeficiency is\\nnot known, although some forms seem to be hereditary.\\nThe main symptom is recurring infections that tend to be\\nchronic rather than acute. Patients may also develop diar-\\nrhea and, as a consequence of the diarrhea, do not absorb\\nfood efficiently. This can lead to malnourishment that can\\naggravate the disorder. Common variable immunodefi-\\nciency normally appears in children after the age of 10.\\nAutoimmune disorderssuch as rheumatoid arthritis ,\\nthyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus and cer-\\ntain cancers such as lymphomas and leukemias may be\\nassociated with common variable immunodeficiency.\\nDiagnosis\\nAs is true of most immunodeficiency disorders, one\\nof the first signs that the patient has the condition is\\nrecurrent infections. Patients with common variable\\nimmunodeficiency are subject to recurrent infections,\\nespecially those caused by microbes that don’t normally\\ncause disease in normal persons. The main diagnostic\\ntest that distinguishes common variable immunodeficien-\\ncy from other immunodeficiency diseases is the low anti-\\nbody level despite the normal number of B cells. Anti-\\nbody levels are tested in the serum by a procedure called\\nelectrophoresis. This procedure both quantifies the\\namount of antibody present and identifies the various\\nclasses of antibodies. The main class of antibody for\\nfighting infectious diseases is IgG.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment that will cure the disorder.\\nTreatment for common variable immunodeficiency aims\\nat boosting the body’s immune response and preventing\\nor controlling infections. Immune serum, obtained from\\ndonated blood, is given as a source of antibodies to boost\\nthe immune response. Immune serum is obtained from\\ndonated blood. It contains whatever antibodies the\\ndonors had in their blood.

These scans allow for cross-\\nsectional views of body organs and tissues.\\nPurpose\\nCT scans are used to image a wide variety of body\\nstructures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CT\\nequipment has become more affordable and available. In\\nsome diagnoses, CT scans have become the first imaging\\nexam of choice. Because the computerized image is so\\nsharp, focused, and three-dimensional, many tissues can\\nbe better differentiated than on standard x rays. Common\\nCT indications include:\\n• Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi-\\ntis and bone fractures . Physicians may order a CT of\\nthe sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery.\\n• Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas,\\ntumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning,\\nespecially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for more\\ninvasive procedures such as cerebral angiography.\\n• Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used\\nto observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid-\\nneys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, and\\nextremities.\\n• Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or\\nabdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possible\\naortic diseases.\\n• Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin-\\nguishing tumors and in detailing accumulation of fluid\\nin chest infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPregnant women or those who could possibly be\\npregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnostic\\nbenefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par-\\nticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the exam\\nis necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists are\\ninstructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnant\\npatients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from the\\nabdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; most\\nradiation, known as scatter, travels through the body and\\nis not blocked by the apron.\\nContrast agents are often used in CT exams and the\\nuse of these agents should be discussed with the medical\\nprofessional prior to the procedure. Patients should be\\nasked to sign a consent form concerning the administra-\\ntion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents,\\niodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who are\\nknown to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) should\\ninform the physician prior to the CT scan.\\nDescription\\nComputed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT\\nscan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina-\\ntion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc-\\ntion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi-\\nologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widely\\nused, sometimes in the place of standard x rays.\\nCT equipment\\nA CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa-\\ntient imaging center. Although the equipment looks large\\nand intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com-\\nfortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrow\\ntable, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan-\\nner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle,\\nwhich allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient.\\nThe scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allow\\nfor certain cross-sectional angles.\\nCT procedure\\nThe patient will feel the gantry move very slightly as\\nthe precise adjustments for each sectional image are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n875\\nComputed tomography scans'),\n",

A technologist watches the procedure from a win-\\ndow and views the images on a computer screen.\\nIt is essential that the patient lie very still during the\\nprocedure to prevent motion blurring. In some studies,\\nsuch as chest CTs, the patient will be asked to hold his or\\nher breath during image capture.\\nFollowing the procedure, films of the images are\\nusually printed for the radiologist and referring physician\\nto review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on a\\nspecial computer screen. The procedure time will vary in\\nlength depending on the area being imaged. Average\\nstudy times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patients\\nmay be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width of\\nthe “doughnut” portion of the scanner is such that many\\npatients can be reassured of openness.\\nThe CT image\\nWhile traditional x rays image organs in two dimen-\\nsions, with the possibility that organs in the front of the\\nbody are superimposed over those in the back, CT scans\\nallow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some have\\ncompared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precise\\nsections of the body can be located and imaged as cross-\\nsectional views. The screen before the technologist\\nshows a computer’s analysis of each section detected by\\nthe x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can be\\neasily distinguished.\\nContrast agents\\nContrast agents are often used in CT exams and in\\nother radiology procedures to illuminate certain details\\nof anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con-\\ntrasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, a\\nwater-based contrast agent is administered for specific\\ndiagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used in\\ngastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this\\ncontrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con-\\ntrast are usually given when examining the abdomen or\\ncells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest.\\nIodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agent\\nand is given through an intravenous needle.\\nIf contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will\\nbe administered several minutes before the study begins.\\nAbdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrast\\nmedium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush-\\ning of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an\\nintravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo-\\ngists have equipment and training to help patients through\\nthese minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions.\\nSevere reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur.\\nSpiral CT\\nSpiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version\\nof CT scanning which is continuous in motion and\\nallows for three-dimensional recreation of images. For\\nexample, traditional CT allows the technologist to take\\nslices at very small and precise intervals one after the\\nother. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images,\\nwithout stopping the scanner to move to the next image\\nslice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability to\\nreconstruct images anywhere along the length of the\\nstudy area. The procedure also speeds up the imaging\\nprocess, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. The\\nability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected,\\nwhen it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi-\\nral CT’s high speed.\\nSome facilities will have both spiral and convention-\\nal CT available. Although spiral is more advantageous\\nfor many applications, conventional CT is still a superior\\nand precise method for imaging many tissues and struc-\\ntures. The physician will evaluate which type of CT\\nworks best for the specific exam purpose.\\nPreparation\\nIf a contrast medium is administered, the patient\\nmay be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior to\\nthe procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown (like\\na typical hospital gown) to be worn during the procedure.\\nAll metal and jewelry should be removed to avoid arti-\\nfacts on the film.\\nAftercare\\nNo aftercare is generally required following a CT\\nscan. Immediately following the exam, the technologist\\nwill continue to watch the patient for possible adverse\\ncontrast reactions.

Tissues and fat will show as\\nvarious shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black.\\nAir will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con-\\ntrast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determine\\nif tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity of\\nthe gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut through\\na section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensional\\nviewing for the radiologist and referring physician.\\nAbnormal results\\nAbnormal results may show different characteristics\\nof tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood or other\\nfluids where they do not belong may be detected. Radiol-\\nogists can differentiate among types of tumors through-\\nout the body by viewing details of their makeup.\\nSinus studies\\nThe increasing availability and lowered cost of CT\\nscanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies,\\neither as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-up\\nto an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CT\\nallows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularly\\nchronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca-\\ntion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreign\\nbodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detected\\nby CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat-\\ning trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedge\\nshaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors will\\nshow as shades of gray indicating the difference in their\\ndensity from that of normal tissues in the area.\\nBrain studies\\nThe precise differences in density allowed by CT scan\\ncan clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain area\\nas altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on the\\nimage may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain\\nand skull area. Different types of tumors can be identified\\nby the presence of edema, by the tissue’s density, or by\\nstudying blood vessel location and activity. The speed and\\nconvenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhage\\nbefore symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities in\\nchildren, such as hydrocephalus, may also be confirmed\\nwith CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of the\\nfluid structures called ventricles of the brain.\\nBody scans\\nThe body scan can identify abnormal body structures\\nand organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicate\\ntumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec-\\ntions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer.\\nTumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeup\\nthan primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca-\\ntion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga-\\nments will be more easily seen on the sensitive images\\nproduced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually done\\nfor these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed\\nor fatty liver, may be observed on the body scan.\\nCT of the aorta\\nCT provides the ability to see and measure the thick-\\nness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos-\\ning aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help see\\ndetails within the aorta. In addition, density can identify\\ncalcification, and this helps differentiate between acute\\nand chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi-\\ncate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested by\\nsigns such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escape\\nof blood from its cavity.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n877\\nComputed tomography scans\\nComputerized CT scan of facial sinuses.

The injured person may\\nremain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is\\ndisoriented for some minutes after the blow. According\\nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\\napproximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderate\\nsports-related brain injuries each year, most of them\\nyoung men between 16 and 25.\\nWhile concussion usually resolves on its own with-\\nout lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much more\\nserious condition. “Second impact syndrome” occurs\\nwhen a person with a concussion, even a very mild one,\\nsuffers a second blow before fully recovering from the\\nfirst. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres-\\nsure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 such\\ncases have been reported since the syndrome was first\\ndescribed in 1984.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nMost concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci-\\ndents and sports injuries .

Other significant causes include falls, col-\\nlisions, or blows due to bicycling, horseback riding, ski-\\ning, and soccer.\\nThe risk of concussion from football is extremely\\nhigh, especially at the high school level. Studies show\\nthat approximately one in five players suffer concussion\\nor more serious brain injury during their brief high-\\nschool careers. The rate at the collegiate level is approxi-\\nmately 1 in 20. Rates for hockey players are not known\\nas certainly, but are believed to be similar.\\nConcussion and lasting brain damage is an especial-\\nly significant risk for boxers, since the goal of the sport\\nis, in fact, to deliver a concussion to the opponent. For\\nthis reason, the American Academy of Neurology has\\ncalled for a ban on boxing. Repeated concussions over\\nmonths or years can cause cumulative head injury. The\\ncumulative brain injuries suffered by most boxers can\\nlead to permanent brain damage.

Guidelines for return-\\ning to sports activities are based on the severity of the\\nconcussion.\\nA grade 1 concussion can usually be treated with\\nrest and continued observation alone. The person may\\nreturn to sports activities that same day, but only after\\nexamination by a trained professional, and after all\\nsymptoms have completely resolved. If the person sus-\\ntains a second concussion of any severity that same day,\\nhe or she should not be allowed to continue contact\\nsports until he or she has been symptom-free, during\\nboth rest and activity, for one week.\\nA person with a grade 2 concussion must discontin-\\nue sports activity for the day, should be evaluated by a\\ntrained professional, and should be observed closely\\nthroughout the day to make sure that all symptoms have\\ncompletely cleared. Worsening of symptoms, or continu-\\nation of any symptoms beyond one week, indicates the\\nneed for a CT or MRI scan. Return to contact sports\\nshould only occur after one week with no symptoms,\\nboth at rest and during activity, and following examina-\\ntion by a physician. Following a second grade 2 concus-\\nsion, the person should remain symptom-free for two\\nweeks before resuming contact sports.\\nA person with a grade 3 concussion (involving any\\nloss of consciousness, no matter how brief) should be\\nexamined by a medical professional either on the scene or\\nin an emergency room. More severe symptoms may war-\\nrant a CT or MRI scan, along with a thorough neurological\\nand physical exam. The person should be hospitalized if\\nany abnormalities are found or if confusion persists. Pro-\\nlonged unconsciousness and worsening symptoms require\\nurgent neurosurgical evaluation or transfer to a trauma cen-\\nter. Following discharge from professional care, the patient\\nis closely monitored for neurological symptoms which may\\narise or worsen. If headaches or other symptoms worsen or\\nlast longer than one week, a CT or MRI scan should be per-\\nformed. Contact sports are avoided for one week following\\nunconsciousness of only seconds, and for two weeks for\\nunconsciousness of a minute or more. A person receiving a\\nsecond grade 3 concussion should avoid contact sports for\\nat least a month after all symptoms have cleared, and then\\nonly with the approval of a physician. If signs of brain\\nswelling or bleeding are seen on a CT or MRI scan, the ath-\\nlete should not return to the sport for the rest of the season,\\nor even indefinitely.\\nFor someone who has sustained a concussion of any\\nseverity, it is critically important that he or she avoid the\\npossibility of another blow to the head until well after all\\nsymptoms have cleared to prevent second-impact syn-\\ndrome. The guidelines above are designed to minimize\\nthe risk of this syndrome.\\nPrognosis\\nConcussion usually leaves no lasting neurological\\nproblems. Nonetheless, symptoms of post-concussion\\nsyndrome may last for weeks or even months.\\nStudies of concussion in contact sports have shown\\nthat the risk of sustaining a second concussion is even\\ngreater than it was for the first if the person continues to\\nengage in the sport.\\nPrevention\\nMany cases of concussion can be prevented by using\\nappropriate protective equipment. This includes seat\\nbelts and air bags in automobiles, and helmets in all con-\\ntact sports. Helmets should also be worn when bicycling,\\nskiing, or horseback riding. Soccer players should avoid\\nheading the ball when it is kicked at high velocity from\\nclose range. Playground equipment should be underlaid\\nwith soft material, either sand or special matting.\\nThe value of high-contact sports such as boxing,\\nfootball, or hockey should be weighed against the high\\nrisk of brain injury during a young person’s participation\\nin the sport. Steering a child’s general enthusiasm for\\nsports into activities less apt to produce head impacts\\nmay reduce the likelihood of brain injury.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEvans, R.

They often\\nbegin using and abusing drugs and alcohol, and having\\nsex at an early age. Irritability, temper tantrums, and\\nlow self-esteem are common personality traits of chil-\\ndren with CD.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two sub-types of CD, one beginning in\\nchildhood and the other in adolescence. There is no\\nknown cause. Researchers and physicians suggest that\\nthis disease may be caused by the following:\\n• poor parent-child relationships\\n• dysfunctional families\\n• drug abuse\\n• physical abuse\\n• poor relationships with other children\\n• cognitive problems leading to school failures\\n• brain damage\\n• biological defects\\nDifficulty in school is an early sign of potential con-\\nduct disorder problems. While the patient’s IQ tends to\\nbe in the normal range, they can have trouble with verbal\\nand abstract reasoning skills and may lag behind their\\nclassmates, and consequently, feel as if they don’t “fit\\nin.” The frustration and loss of self-esteem resulting from\\nthis academic and social inadequacy can trigger the\\ndevelopment of CD.\\nA dysfunctional home environment can be another\\nmajor contributor to CD. An emotionally, physically, or\\nsexually abusive home environment, a family history of\\nantisocial personality disorder, or parental substance\\nabuse can damage a child’s perceptions of himself and\\nput him on a path toward negative behavior. Other less\\nobvious environmental factors can also play a part in the\\ndevelopment of conduct disorder. Long-term studies\\nhave shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy\\nmay be linked to the development of CD in boys. Ani-\\nmal and human studies point out that nicotine can have\\nundesirable effects on babies. These include altered\\nstructure and function of their nervous systems, learning\\ndeficits, and behavioral problems. In a study of 177 boys\\nages seven-12 years, those with mothers who smoked\\nover one half a package of cigarettes daily while preg-\\nnant were more apt to have a CD than those with moth-\\ners who did not smoke.\\nOther conditions that may cause or co-exist with CD\\ninclude head injury , substance abuse disorder, major\\ndepressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity\\ndisorder (ADHD). Thirty to fifty percent of children\\ndiagnosed with ADHD, a disorder characterized by a\\npersistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, also\\nhave CD.\\nCD is defined as a repetitive behavioral pattern of\\nviolating the rights of others or societal norms. Three of\\nthe following criteria, or symptoms, are required over the\\nprevious 12 months for a diagnosis of CD (one of the\\nthree must have occurred in the past six months):\\n• bullies, threatens, or intimidates others\\n• picks fights\\n• has used a dangerous weapon\\n• has been physically cruel to people\\n• has been physically cruel to animals\\n• has stolen while confronting a victim (for example,\\nmugging or extortion)\\n• has forced someone into sexual activity\\n• has deliberately set a fire with the intention of causing\\ndamage\\n• has deliberately destroyed property of others\\n• has broken into someone else’s house or car\\n• frequently lies to get something or to avoid obligations\\n• has stolen without confronting a victim or breaking and\\nentering (e.g., shoplifting or forgery)\\n• stays out at night; breaks curfew (beginning before 13\\nyears of age)\\n• has run away from home overnight at least twice (or\\nonce for a lengthy period)\\n• is often truant from school (beginning before 13 years\\nof age).\\nDiagnosis\\nCD is diagnosed and treated by a number of social\\nworkers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and psycholo-\\ngists. Genuine diagnosis may require psychiatric exper-\\ntise to rule out such conditions as bipolar disorder or\\nADHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the child should\\nideally include interviews with the child and parents, a\\nfull social and medical history, a cognitive evaluation,\\nand a psychiatric exam. One or more clinical inventories\\nor scales may be used to assess the child for conduct dis-\\norder—including the Youth Self-Report, the Overt\\nAggression Scale (OAS), Behavioral Assessment Sys-\\ntem for Children (BASC), Child Behavior Checklist\\n(CBCL), and Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-\\ndren (DISC).

Because\\ncortisol production is impeded, the adrenal gland instead\\noverproduces androgens (male steroid hormones).\\nFemales with CAH are born with an enlarged clitoris and\\nnormal internal reproductive tract structures. Males have\\nnormal genitals at birth. CAH causes abnormal growth\\nfor both sexes; patients will be tall as children and short\\nas adults. Females develop male characteristics, and\\nmales experience premature sexual development.\\nIn its most severe form, called salt-wasting CAH, a\\nlife-threatening adrenal crisis can occur if the disorder\\nis untreated. Adrenal crisis can cause dehydration ,\\nshock, and death within 14 days of birth. There is also\\na mild form of CAH that occurs later in childhood or\\nyoung adult life in which patients have partial enzyme\\ndeficiency.\\nCAH, a genetic disorder, is the most common adren-\\nal gland disorder in infants and children, occurring in one\\nin 10,000 total births worldwide. It affects both females\\nand males. It is also called adrenogenital syndrome.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCAH is an inherited disorder. It is a recessive dis-\\nease, which means that a child must inherit one copy of\\nthe defective gene from each parent who is a carrier;\\nwhen two carriers have children, each pregnancy carries\\na 25% risk of producing an affected child.\\nIn females, CAH produces an enlarged clitoris at\\nbirth and masculinization of features as the child grows,\\nsuch as deepening of the voice, facial hair, and failure to\\nmenstruate or abnormal periods at puberty . Females\\nwith severe CAH may be mistaken for males at birth. In\\nmales, the genitals are normal at birth, but the child\\nbecomes muscular, the penis enlarges, pubic hair\\nappears, and the voice deepens long before normal\\npuberty, sometimes as early as two to three years of age.\\nIn the severe salt-wasting form of CAH, newborns\\nmay develop symptoms shortly after birth, including\\nvomiting, dehydration, electrolyte (a compound such as\\nsodium or calcium that separates to form ions when dis-\\nsolved in water) changes, and cardiac arrhythmia.\\nIn the mild form of CAH, which occurs in late child-\\nhood or early adulthood, symptoms include premature\\ndevelopment of pubic hair, irregular menstrual periods,\\nunwanted body hair, or severe acne. However, some-\\ntimes there are no symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nCAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the\\ngenitals and blood and urine tests that measure the hor-\\nmones produced by the adrenal gland. A number of\\nstates in the United States perform a hormonal test (a\\nheel prick blood test) for CAH and other inherited dis-\\neases within a few days of birth. In questionable cases,\\ngenetic testingcan provide a definitive diagnosis. For\\nsome forms of CAH, prenatal diagnosis is possible\\nthrough chronic villus sampling in the first trimester and\\nby measuring certain hormones in the amniotic fluid\\nduring the second trimester.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of treatment for CAH is to return the\\nandrogen levels to normal. This is usually accomplished\\nthrough drug therapy, although surgery is an alternative.\\nLifelong treatment is required.\\nDrug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med-\\nication called a glucocorticoid. Oral hydrocortisone is\\nprescribed for children, and prednisone or dexametha-\\nsone is prescribed for older patients. For patients with\\nsalt-wasting CAH, fludrocortisone, which acts like\\naldosterone (the missing hormone), is also prescribed.\\nInfants and small children may also receive salt tablets,\\nwhile older patients are told to eat salty foods. Medical\\ntherapy achieves hormonal balance most of the time, but\\nCAH patients can have periods of fluctuating hormonal\\ncontrol that lead to increases in the dose of steroids pre-\\nscribed. Side effects of steroids include stunted growth.\\nSteroid therapy should not be suddenly stopped, since\\nadrenal insufficiency results.\\nPatients with CAH should see a pediatric endocrinol-\\nogist frequently.

This condition may be the\\nresult of the constriction of fibrous bands within the\\nmembrane that surrounds the developing fetus (amniotic\\nband syndrome) or the exposure to substances known to\\ncause birth defects (teratogenic agents). Other factors,\\nincluding genetics, may also play a role.\\nDescription\\nAn estimated one in 2,000 babies are born with all\\nor part of a limb missing, ranging from a missing part of\\na finger to the absence of both arms and both legs. Con-\\ngenital amputation is the least common reason for\\namputation. However, there are occasional periods in\\nhistory where the number of congenital amputations\\nincreased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of the\\nearly 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in western\\nEurope were given a tranquilizer containing the drug.\\nThe result was a drastic increase in the number of babies\\nborn with deformed limbs. In this example, the birth\\ndefect usually presented itself as very small, deformed\\nversions of normal limbs. More recently, birth defects as\\na result of radiation exposure near the site of the Cher-\\nnobyl disaster in Russia have left numerous children\\nwith malformed or absent limbs.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of congenital amputations is\\nunknown. However, according to the March of Dimes,\\nmost birth defects have one or more genetic factors and\\none or more environmental factors. It is also known that\\nmost birth defects occur in the first three months of preg-\\nnancy, when the organs of the fetus are forming. Within\\nthese crucial first weeks, frequently prior to when a\\nwoman is aware of the pregnancy, the developing fetus is\\nmost susceptible to substances that can cause birth\\ndefects (teratogens). Exposure to teratogens can cause\\ncongenital amputation. In other cases, tight amniotic\\nbands may constrict the developing fetus, preventing a\\nlimb from forming properly, if at all. It is estimated that\\nthis amniotic band syndrome occurs in between one in\\n12,000 and one in 15,000 live births.\\nAn infant with congenital amputation may be miss-\\ning an entire limb or just a portion of a limb. Congenital\\namputation resulting in the complete absence of a limb\\nbeyond a certain point (and leaving a stump) is called\\ntransverse deficiency or amelia. Longitudinal deficien-\\ncies occur when a specific part of a limb is missing; for\\nexample, when the fibula bone in the lower leg is miss-\\ning, but the rest of the leg is intact. Phocomelia is the\\ncondition in which only a mid-portion of a limb is miss-\\ning, as when the hands or feet are attached directly to\\nthe trunk.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany cases of congenital amputation are not diag-\\nnosed until the baby is born. Ultrasound examinations\\nmay reveal the absence of a limb in some developing\\nfetuses, but routine ultrasounds may not pick up signs of\\nmore subtle defects. However, if a doctor suspects that\\nthe fetus is at risk for developing a limb deficiency (for\\nexample, if the mother has been exposed to radiation), a\\nmore detailed ultrasound examination may be performed.\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful treatment of a child with congenital\\namputation involves an entire medical team, including a\\npediatrician, an orthopedist, a psychiatrist or psycholo-\\ngist, a prosthetist (an expert in making prosthetics, or\\nartificial limbs), a social worker, and occupational and\\nphysical therapists. The accepted method of treatment is\\nto fit the child early with a functional prosthesis because\\nthis leads to normal development and less wasting away\\n(atrophy) of the muscles of the limbs present. However,\\nsome parents and physicians believe that the child should\\nbe allowed to learn to play and perform tasks without a\\nprosthesis, if possible. When the child is older, he or she\\ncan be involved in the decision of whether or not to be\\nfitted for a prosthesis.\\nRecently, there have been cases in which physicians\\nhave detected amniotic band constriction interfering with\\nlimb development fairly early in its course. In 1997, doc-\\ntors at the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Ther-\\napy reported two cases in which minimally invasive\\nsurgery freed constricting amniotic bands and preserved\\nthe affected limbs.\\nAlternative treatment\\nPrevention of birth defects begins with building the\\nwell-being of the mother before pregnancy.

An\\nexstrophic bladder is one that is open to the outside and\\nturned inside-out, so that its inside is visible at birth, pro-\\ntruding from the lower abdomen. A diverticulum is an\\nextension of a hollow organ, usually shaped like a pouch\\nwith a narrow opening.\\nDescription\\nDuring fetal development, folds enclose tissues and\\norgans and eventually fuse at the edges to form sealed\\ncompartments. Both in the front and the back, folds\\neventually become major body structures. In the back,\\nthe entire spinal column folds in like a pipe wrapped in a\\npillow. In the front, the entire lower urinary system is\\nfolded in.\\n• Exstrophy of the bladder represents a failure of this\\nfolding process to complete itself, so the organs form\\nwith more or less of their front side missing and open to\\nthe outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvic\\nbone is widely separated. The abdominal wall is open,\\ntoo. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to the\\npenis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female.\\n• A congenital bladder diverticulum represent an area of\\nweakness in the bladder wall through which extrudes\\nsome of the lining of the bladder. (A small balloon\\nsqueezed in a fist will create diverticula-like effect\\nbetween the fingers.) Bladder diverticula may be multi-\\nple, and they often occur at the ureterovesical junc-\\ntion—the entrance of the upper urinary system into the\\nbladder. In this location, they may cause urine to reflux\\ninto the ureter and kidney, leading to infection and pos-\\nsible kidney damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs with many birth defects, the causes are not well\\nknown. Lack of prenatal care and nutrition has been\\nlinked to many birth defects; however, beyond the avoid-\\nance of known teratogens (anything that can cause a birth\\ndefect), there is little prevention possible. Exstrophy is\\nrare, occurring in about one in 40,000 births. Diverticula\\nare more common, but less serious.\\nIf left untreated, the patient with bladder exstrophy\\nwill have no control over urination and is more likely to\\ndevelop bladder cancer . Diverticula, particularly if it\\ncauses urine reflux, may lead to chronic infection and its\\nsubsequent consequences.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2888\\nCongenital bladder anomalies'),\n",

Further, each one\\nis unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy can\\ninvolve the rectum and large bowel and coexist with\\nhernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birth\\nwill prompt immediate action and a search for other\\nanomalies.\\nDiverticula are not visible and will be detected only\\nif they cause trouble. They are usually found in an\\nexamination for the cause of recurring urinary infec-\\ntions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy\\n(examination with a telescope-like instrument) will\\nidentify them. Often, the two procedures are done\\ntogether: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then a\\nradiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladder\\nand take x rays.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is necessary and can usually produce suc-\\ncessful results. If possible, the surgery must be done\\nwithin 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposed\\norgans must be protected and all related defects identi-\\nfied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to the\\nfrequent need to divert the urine into the bowel\\nbecause the partially repaired bladder cannot control\\nthe flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infection\\nrequires monitoring.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAfter surgery ongoing precautions to reduce fre-\\nquency of infection may need to be used. Cranberry\\njuice has the ability to keep bacteria from adhering to\\nthe membranes and can help prevent infection when-\\never there is increased risk. There are botanical and\\nhomeopathic treatments available, however consulta-\\ntion by a trained practitioner is recommended before\\ntreatment.\\nPrognosis\\nWith immediate surgery, three-quarters of patients\\ncan be successfully repaired. They will have control of\\ntheir urine and no long-term consequences. The rate of\\ninfection is greater for those with congenital bladder\\nanomalies, since any abnormality in the urinary system\\npredisposes it to invasion by bacteria.\\nPrevention\\nBirth defects often have no precisely identified\\ncause, therefore prevention is limited to general mea-\\nsures such as early and continuous prenatal care, appro-\\npriate nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCongenital—Present at birth.\\nCystoscopy —Examination of the urinary bladder\\nwith a thin telescope-like instrument.\\nExstrophy—Being turned inside out combined\\nwith being outside the body.\\nDiverticulum—A pouch extending from a hollow\\norgan.\\nRadiologist—A physician who specializes in cre-\\nating images of the internal organs of the body.\\nTeratogen—Any agent that can cause birth defects.\\nUreter—The tube that transports urine from the\\nkidney to the bladder.\\nUreterovesical junction—The joining of the ureter\\nto the bladder.\\nUrologist—A surgeon who specializes in diseases\\nof the urinary system.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Anomalies of the Bladder.” In Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics,\\ned.

Interruption of this program, especially early in\\ndevelopment, can cause structural defects in the brain.\\nIn addition, normal brain formation requires proper\\ndevelopment of the surrounding skull, and skull defects\\nmay lead to brain malformation. Congenital brain\\ndefects may be caused by inherited genetic defects,\\nspontaneous mutations within the genes of the embryo,\\nor effects on the embryo due to the mother’s infection,\\ntrauma, or drug use.\\nEarly on in development, a flat strip of tissue\\nalong the back of the fetus rolls up to form a tube. This\\nso-called “neural tube” develops into the spinal cord,\\nand at one end, the brain. Closure of the tube is\\nrequired for subsequent development of the tissue\\nwithin. Anencephaly (literally “without brain”), results\\nwhen the topmost portion of the tube fails to close.\\nAnencephaly is the most common severe malformation\\nseen in stillborn births. It is about four times more\\ncommon in females than males. Anencephaly is some-\\ntimes seen to run in families, and for parents who have\\nconceived one anencephalic fetus, the risk of a second\\nis as high as 5%. Fewer than half of babies with anen-\\ncephaly are born alive, and survival beyond the first\\nmonth is rare.\\nEncephalocele is a protrusion of part of the brain\\nthrough a defect in the skull. The most common site for\\nencephalocele is along the front-to-back midline of the\\nskull, usually at the rear, although frontal encephaloceles\\nare more common among Asians. Pressure within the\\nskull pushes out cranial tissue. The protective layer over\\nthe brain, the meninges, grows to cover the protrusion, as\\ndoes skin in some cases. Defects in skull closure are\\nthought to cause some cases of encephalocele, while\\ndefects in neural tube closure may cause others.\\nEncephaloceles may be small and contain little or no\\nbrain tissue, or may be quite large and contain a signifi-\\ncant fraction of the brain.\\nFailure of neural-tube closure below the level of\\nthe brain prevents full development of the surrounding\\nvertebral bones and leads to spina bifida , or a divided\\nspinal column. Incomplete closure causes protrusion\\nof the spinal cord and meninges, called meningomye-\\nlocele. Some cases of spina bifida are accompanied by\\nanother defect at the base of the brain, known as the\\nArnold-Chiari malformation or Chiari II malforma-\\ntion. For reasons that are unclear, part of the cerebel-\\nlum is displaced downward into the spinal column.\\nSymptoms may be present at birth or delayed until\\nearly childhood.\\nThe Dandy-Walker malformation is marked by\\nincomplete formation, or absence of, the central section\\nof the cerebellum, and the growth of cysts within the\\nlowest of the brain’s ventricles. The ventricles are fluid-\\nfilled cavities within the brain, through which cere-\\nbrospinal fluid (CSF) normally circulates. The cysts\\nmay block the exit of the fluid, causing hydrocephalus.\\nSymptoms may be present at birth or delayed until early\\nchildhood.\\nSoon after closure of the neural tube, the brain\\ndivides into two halves, or hemispheres. Failure of divi-\\nsion is termed holoprosencephaly (literally “whole\\nforebrain”). Holoprosencephaly is almost always\\naccompanied by facial and cranial deformities along the\\nmidline, including cleft lip, cleft palate, fused eye sock-\\nets and a single eye (cyclopia), and deformities of the\\nlimbs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other internal\\norgans. Most infants are either stillborn or die soon\\nafter birth. Survivors suffer from severe neurological\\nimpairments.\\nThe normal ridges and valleys of the mature brain\\nare formed after cells from the inside of the developing\\nbrain migrate to the outside and multiply. When these\\ncells fail to migrate, the surface remains smooth, a con-\\ndition called lissencephaly (“smooth brain”). Lissen-\\ncephaly is often associated with facial abnormalities\\nincluding a small jaw, a high forehead, a short nose, and\\nlow-set ears.\\nIf damaged during growth, especially within the\\nfirst 20 weeks, brain tissue may stop growing, while\\ntissue around it continues to form. This causes an\\nabnormal cleft or groove to appear on the surface of\\nthe brain, called schizencephaly (literally “split\\nbrain”). This cleft should not be confused with the nor-\\nmal wrinkled brain surface, nor should the name be\\nmistaken for schizophrenia , a mental disorder. Gener-\\nalized destruction of tissue or lack of brain develop-\\nment may lead to hydranencephaly, in which cere-\\nbrospinal fluid fills much of the space normally occu-\\npied by the brain. Hydranencephaly is distinct from\\nhydrocephalus, in which CSF accumulates within a\\nnormally-formed brain, putting pressure on it and pos-\\nsibly causing skull expansion.\\nExcessive brain size is termed megalencephaly (lit-\\nerally “big brain”). Megalencephaly is defined as any\\nbrain size above the 98th percentile within the popula-\\ntion. Some cases are familial, and may be entirely\\nbenign. Others are due to metabolic or neurologic dis-\\nease. The opposite condition, microcephaly, may be\\ncaused by failure of the brain to develop, or by intrauter-\\nine infection, drug toxicity, or brain trauma.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n890\\nCongenital brain defects'),\n",

This con-\\ndition has been more recently termed developmental hip\\ndysplasia, as it often develops over the first few weeks,\\nmonths, or years of life.\\nDescription\\nCongenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children\\nthat is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. During\\ngestation, the infant’s hip should be developing with the\\nhead of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centered\\nin its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulum\\nshould cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit-\\nting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla-\\nsia, the development of the acetabulum in an infant\\nallows the femoral head to ride upward out of the joint\\nsocket, especially when weight bearing begins.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nClinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip\\ndysplasia, with more females affected than males. This\\ndisorder is found in many cultures around the world.\\nHowever, statistics show that the Native American popu-\\nlation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This has\\nbeen documented to be due to the common practice of\\nswaddling and using cradleboards for restraining the\\ninfants. This places the infant’s hips into extreme adduc-\\ntion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hip\\ndysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian and\\nbreech position births. Evidence also shows a greater\\nchance of this hip abnormality in the first born compared\\nto the second or third child. Hormonal changes within the\\nmother during pregnancy, resulting in increased ligament\\nlaxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placenta\\nand cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in the\\nwomb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include a\\nshortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause the abnormalities of this hip problem often\\nvary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for\\nan accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. The\\nhip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip to\\ndetermine if the head of the femur is moving in and out\\nof the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolani\\ntest, begins with each of the examiners’ hands around the\\ninfant’s knees, with the second and third fingers pointing\\ndown the child’s thigh. With the legs abducted (moved\\napart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinct\\nclicking sound with motion. If symptoms are present\\nwith a noted increase in abduction, the test is considered\\npositive for hip joint instability. It is important to note\\nthis test is only valid a few weeks after birth.\\nThe Barlow method is another test performed with the\\ninfant’s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi-\\ntion. The examiner’s middle finger is placed over the out-\\nside of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the inner\\nside of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be felt\\nif the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In older\\nbabies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip or\\neven both hips, it is possible that the movement is blocked\\nbecause the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con-\\ntracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca-\\ntion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other.\\nX-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find-\\nings of the hip joint.

Ultrasound has been noted as a safe and effective\\ntool for the diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. Ultra-\\nsound has advantages over x rays, as several positions are\\nnoted during the ultrasound procedure. This is in contrast\\nto only one position observed during the x ray.\\nTreatment\\nThe objective of treatment is to replace the head of the\\nfemur into the acetabulum and, by applying constant pres-\\nsure, to enlarge and deepen the socket. In the past, stabi-\\nlization was achieved by placing rolled cotton diapers or a\\npillow between the thighs, thereby keeping the knees in a\\nfrog like position. More recently, the Pavlik harness and\\nvon Rosen splint are commonly used in infants up to the\\nage of six months. A stiff shell cast may be used, which\\nachieves the same purpose, spreading the legs apart and\\nforcing the head of the femur into the acetabulum. In some\\ncases, in older children between six to 18 months, surgery\\nmay be necessary to reposition the joint. Also at this age,\\nthe use of closed manipulation may be applied successful-\\nly, by moving the leg around manually to replace joint.\\nOperations are not only performed to reduce the disloca-\\ntion of the hip, but also to repair a defect in the acetabu-\\nlum. A cast is applied after the operation to hold the head\\nof the femur in the correct position. The use of a home\\ntractionprogram is now more common. However, after\\nthe age of eight years, surgical procedures are primarily\\ndone for pain reduction measures only. Total hip surgeries\\nmay be inevitable later in adulthood.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNonsurgical treatments include exercise programs,\\northosis (a force system, often involving braces), and\\nmedications. A physical therapist may develop a program\\nthat includes strengthening, range-of-motion exercises,\\npain control, and functional activities. Chiropractic\\nmedicine may be helpful, especially the procedures of\\nclosed manipulations, to reduce the dislocated hip joint.\\nPrognosis\\nUnless corrected soon after birth, abnormal stresses\\ncause malformation of the developing femur, with a char-\\nacteristic limp or waddling gait. If cases of congenital\\nhip dysplasia go untreated, the child will have difficulty\\nwalking, which could result in life-long pain. In addition,\\nif this condition goes untreated, the abnormal hip posi-\\ntioning will force the acetabulum to locate to another\\nposition to accommodate the displaced femur.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention includes proper prenatal care to deter-\\nmine the position of the baby in the womb.

Ureters can be duplicated com-\\npletely or partially, they can be in the wrong place, they\\ncan be deformed, and they can end in the wrong place.\\nThe trouble these abnormalities bring is directly related\\nto their effect on the flow of urine. As long as urine flows\\nnormally through them, and only in one direction, no\\nharm is done.\\n• Duplication of ureters is quite common, either in part or\\ncompletely. Kidneys are sometimes duplicated as well.\\nSomeone may have four kidneys and four ureters or two\\nkidneys, half of each drained by a separate ureter, or a sin-\\ngle kidney with two, three, or four ureters attached. As\\nlong as urine can flow easily in the correct direction, such\\nmalformations may never be detected. If, however, one of\\nthe ureters has a dead end, a stricture or stenosis (narrow-\\ning), or a leaky ureterovesical valve (valve between the\\nureter and bladder), infection is the likely result.\\n• Stricture or stenosis of a ureter prevents urine from\\nflowing freely. Whenever flow is obstructed in the\\nbody—urine, bile, mucus, or any other liquid—infec-\\ntion follows. Ureters can be obstructed anywhere along\\ntheir course, though the ureterovesical valve is the most\\ncommon place.\\n• A ureter may have an ectopic (out of place) orifice\\n(opening)—it may enter the bladder, or even another\\nstructure, where it does not belong and therefore with-\\nout an adequate valve to control reflux.\\n• The primary ureter, or a duplicate, may not even reach\\nthe bladder, but rather terminate in a dead end. Urine\\nwill stagnate there and eventually cause infection.\\n• A ureter can be perfectly normal but in the wrong place,\\nsuch as behind the vena cava (the large vein in the mid-\\ndle of the abdomen). A so-called retrocaval ureter may\\nbe pinched by the vena cava so that flow is hindered.\\nOther aberrant locations may also lead to compression\\nand impaired flow.\\nBesides infection, urine that backs up will cause the\\nureter and the kidney to dilate. Eventually, the kidney\\nwill stop functioning because of the back pressure. This\\ncondition is called hydronephrosis—a kidney swollen\\nwith urine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of birth defects are multiple and often\\nunknown.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\\nCongestive cardiomyopathy\\nDefinition\\nCardiomyopathy is an ongoing disease process that\\ndamages the muscle wall of the lower chambers of the\\nheart. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the most common\\nform of cardiomyopathy. In congestive cardiomyopathy,\\nalso called dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heart\\nchambers stretch (dilate) to hold a greater volume of\\nblood than normal. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the\\nfinal stage of many heart diseases and the most common\\ncondition resulting in congestive heart failure.\\nDescription\\nAbout 50,000 Americans develop cardiomyopathy\\neach year. Of those, 87% have congestive cardiomyopa-\\nthy. Primary cardiomyopathy accounts for only 1% of all\\ndeaths from heart disease.\\nWhen the heart muscle is damaged by a disease\\nprocess, it cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s\\nneeds. Uninjured areas of the walls of the two lower heart\\nchambers (called ventricles) stretch to make up for the\\nlost pumping action. At first, the enlarged chambers allow\\nmore blood to be pumped with less force. The stretched\\nmuscle can also contract more forcefully. Over time, the\\nheart muscle continues to stretch, ultimately becoming\\nweaker. The heart is forced to work harder to pump blood\\nby beating faster. Eventually it cannot keep up, and blood\\nbacks up into the veins, legs, and lungs. When this hap-\\npens, the condition is called congestive heart failure.\\nCongestive cardiomyopathy usually affects both\\nventricles. Blood backed up into the lungs from the left\\nventricle causes fluid to congest the lung tissue. This is\\ncalled pulmonary edema. When the right ventricle fails\\nto pump enough blood, blood backs up into the veins\\ncausing edema in the legs, feet, ankles, and abdomen.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCongestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a\\nnumber of conditions. Cardiomyopathy with a known\\ncause is called secondary cardiomyopathy. When no\\ncause can be identified, it is called primary cardiomyopa-\\nthy or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. About 80% of all cases\\nof cardiomyopathy do not have a known cause. Many\\nheart specialists think that many cases of idiopathic con-\\ngestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a viral infec-\\ntion. Because cardiomyopathy may occur many years\\nafter a viral infection and viruses sometimes go undetect-\\ned in laboratory tests, it is difficult to know if a virus is the\\ncause. Some people have a weak heart from advanced\\ncoronary artery diseasethat causes heart muscle dam-\\nage. This is sometimes called ischemic cardiomyopathy.\\nConditions that can cause congestive cardiomyopa-\\nthy are:\\n• Coronary artery disease\\n• Infections\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n896\\nCongestive cardiomyopathy'),\n",

This type of con-\\ngestive cardiomyopathy is called peripartum cardiomy-\\nopathy. The cause of congestive cardiomyopathy in preg-\\nnancy is not known.\\nCongestive cardiomyopathy usually is a chronic\\ncondition, developing gradually over time. Patients with\\nearly congestive cardiomyopathy may not have symp-\\ntoms. The most common symptoms are fatigue and\\nshortness of breath on exertion. Unfortunately, sudden\\ncardiac death is not uncommon with this condition. It\\nstems from irregular heart rhythms in the ventricles (ven-\\ntricular arrhythmias).\\nPatients with more advanced congestive cardiomy-\\nopathy may also have chest or abdominal pains, extreme\\ntiredness,dizziness, and swelling of the legs and ankles.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy is based on:\\n• symptoms\\n• medical history\\n•physical examination\\n• chest x ray\\n• electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG)\\n• echocardiogram\\n•cardiac catheterization\\nThe diagnosis is based on the patient’s symptoms, a\\ncomplete physical examination, and tests that detect\\nabnormalities of the heart chambers. The physician lis-\\ntens to the heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormal\\nheart rhythms and heart sounds. A heart murmur might\\nmean that the heart valves are not closing properly due to\\nthe ventricles being enlarged.\\nA chest x ray can show if the heart is enlarged and if\\nthere is fluid in the lungs. Abnormalities of heart valves\\nand other structures may also be seen on a chest x ray.\\nAn electrocardiogram provides a record of electrical\\nchanges in the heart muscle during the heartbeat. It gives\\ninformation on the heart rhythm and can show if the\\nheart chamber is enlarged. An ECG can detect damage to\\nthe heart muscle and the amount of damage.\\nEchocardiography uses sound waves to make\\nimages of the heart. These images can show if the heart\\nwall or chambers are enlarged and if there are any abnor-\\nmalities of the heart valves. Echocardiography can also\\nevaluate the pumping efficiency of the ventricles.\\nCardiac catheterization usually is only used if a\\ndiagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiac\\ncatheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is inserted\\ninto an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea-\\nsure pressure in the heart and the amount of blood\\npumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heart\\nmuscle can be removed through the catheter for examina-\\ntion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can show\\nthe type and amount of damage to the heart muscle.\\nTreatment\\nWhen a patient is diagnosed with congestive car-\\ndiomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. If\\ncoronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most other\\ncases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon-\\nsible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed,\\ntreatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi-\\ntion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinking\\nexcess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated by\\neliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In some\\ncases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance is\\nremoved from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treated\\nwith an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria.\\nThere is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy-\\nopathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload of\\nthe heart and to relieve the symptoms.\\nOne or more of the following types of medicines\\nmay be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy:\\n• digitalis\\n•diuretics\\n• vasodilators\\n• beta blockers\\n• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib-\\nitors)\\n• angiotensin receptor blockers\\nDigitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger\\npumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt and\\nwater from the kidneys by making patients urinate more\\noften. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluid\\nbuildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, and\\nACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand the\\nblood vessels so blood can move more easily through\\nthem. This action makes it easier for the heart to pump\\nblood through the vessels.\\nPatients may also be given anticoagulant medica-\\ntions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling of\\nblood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor-\\nmal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but some\\nof these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac-\\ntions.

In coarctation of\\nthe aorta, the aorta is constricted, reducing the flow of\\nblood to the lower part of the body and increasing blood\\npressure in the upper body.\\nA bicuspid aortic valve has only two flaps instead\\nof three, which can lead to stenosis in adulthood.\\nSubaortic stenosis is a narrowing of the left ventricle\\nbelow the aortic valve, that limits the flow of blood from\\nthe left ventricle.\\nSeptal defects\\nWhen a baby is born with a hole in the septum (the\\nwall separating the right and left sides of the heart),\\nblood leaks from the left side of the heart to the right,\\nor from a higher pressure zone to a lower pressure\\nzone. A major leakage can lead to enlargement of the\\nheart and failing circulation. The most common types\\nof septal defects are atrial septal defect , an opening\\nbetween the two upper heart chambers, and ventricu-\\nlar septal defect , an opening between the two lower\\nheart chambers. Ventricular septal defect accounts for\\nabout 15% of all cases of congenital heart disease in\\nthe United States.\\nCyanotic defects\\nHeart disorders that cause a decreased, inadequate\\namount of oxygen in blood pumped to the body are\\ncalled cyanotic defects. Cyanotic defects, including trun-\\ncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return,\\ntetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries,\\nand tricuspid atresia, result in a blue discoloration of the\\nskin due to low oxygen levels. About 10% of cases of\\ncongenital heart disease in the United States are tetralogy\\nof Fallot, which includes four defects. The major defects\\nare a large hole between the ventricles, which allows\\noxygen-poor blood to mix with oxygen-rich blood, and\\nnarrowing at or beneath the pulmonary valve. The other\\ndefects are an overly muscular right ventricle and an\\naorta that lies over the ventricular hole.\\nIn transposition (reversal of position) of the great\\narteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed,\\ncausing oxygen-rich blood to re-circulate to the lungs\\nwhile oxygen-poor blood goes to the rest of the body. In\\ntricuspid atresia, the baby lacks a triscupid valve and\\nblood cannot flow properly from the right atrium to the\\nright ventricle.\\nOther defects\\nEbstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital syndrome that\\ncauses malformed tricuspid valve leaflets, which allow\\nblood to leak between the right ventricle and the right\\natrium. It also may cause a hole in the wall between the\\nleft and right atrium. Treatment often involves repairing\\nthe tricuspid valve. Ebstein’s anomaly may be associated\\nwith maternal use of the psychiatric drug lithium during\\npregnancy.\\nBrugada syndrome is another rare congenital heart\\ndefect that appears in adulthood and may cause sudden\\ndeathif untreated. Symptoms, which include rapid,\\nuneven heart beat, often appear at night. Scientists believe\\nthat Brugada syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene\\nSCN5A, which involves cardiac sodium channels.\\nInfants born with DiGeorge sequence can have heart\\ndefects such as a malformed aortic arch and tetralogy of\\nFallot. Researchers believe DiGeorge sequence is most\\noften caused by mutations in genes in the region 22q11.\\nMarfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder\\nthat causes tears in the aorta. Since the disease also causes\\nexcessive bone growth, most Marfan syndrome patients\\nare over six feet tall. In athletes, and others, it can lead to\\nsudden death. Researchers believe the defect responsible\\nfor Marfan’s syndrome is found in gene FBN1, on chro-\\nmosome 15.\\nAbout 32,000 infants are born every year with con-\\ngenital heart disease, which is the most common birth\\ndefect. About half of these cases require medical treat-\\nment. More than one million people with heart defects\\nare currently living in the United States.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, the causes of congenital heart disease\\nare unknown.

Viral infections, such as German measles, can pro-\\nduce congenital heart disease. Women with diabetes and\\nphenylketonuriaalso are at higher risk of having chil-\\ndren with congenital heart defects. Many cases of congen-\\nital heart disease result from the mother’s excessive use of\\nalcohol or taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine, while\\npregnant. The mother’s exposure to certain anticonvulsant\\nand dermatologic drugs during pregnancy can also cause\\ncongenital heart disease. There are many genetic condi-\\ntions, such as Down syndrome , which affect multiple\\norgans and can cause congenital heart disease.\\nSymptoms of congenital heart disease in general\\ninclude: shortness of breath, difficulty feeding in infan-\\ncy, sweating, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin),\\nheart murmur, respiratory infections that recur excessive-\\nly, stunted growth, and limbs and muscles that are under-\\ndeveloped.\\nSymptoms of specific types of congenital heart dis-\\nease are as follows:\\n• Patent ductus arteriosus: quick tiring, slow growth, sus-\\nceptibility to pneumonia, rapid breathing. If the ductus\\nis small, there are no symptoms.\\n• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: ashen color, rapid and\\ndifficult breathing, inability to eat.\\n• Obstruction defects: cyanosis (skin that is discolored\\nblue), chest pain, tiring easily, dizziness or fainting ,\\ncongestive heart failure, and high blood pressure.\\n• Septal defects: difficulty breathing, stunted growth.\\nSometimes there are no symptoms.\\n• Cyanotic defects: cyanosis, sudden rapid breathing or\\nunconsciousness, and shortness of breath and fainting\\nduring exercise.\\nDiagnosis\\nEchocardiographyand cardiac magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) are used to confirm congenital\\nheart disease when it is suggested by the symptoms and\\nphysical examination. An echocardiograph will display\\nan image of the heart that is formed by sound waves. It\\ndetects valve and other heart problems. Fetal echocardio-\\ngraphy is used to diagnose congenital heart disease in\\nutero, usually after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Between 10\\nand 14 weeks of pregnancy, physicians also may use an\\nultrasound to look for a thickness at the nuchal translu-\\ncency, a pocket of fluid in back of the embryo’s neck,\\nwhich may indicate a cardiac defect in 55% of cases.\\nCardiac MRI, a scanning method that uses magnetic\\nKEY TERMS\\nAorta—The main artery located above the heart\\nthat pumps oxygenated blood out into the body.\\nMany congenital heart defects affect the aorta.\\nCongenital—Refers to a disorder that is present at\\nbirth.\\nCyanotic—Marked by bluish discoloration of the\\nskin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood.

Surgical procedures include: arterial\\nswitch, balloon atrial septostomy,balloon valvulo-\\nplasty, Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, Fontan proce-\\ndure, pulmonary artery banding, Ross procedure, shunt\\nprocedure, and venous switch or intra-atrial baffle.\\nArterial switch, to correct transposition of the great\\narteries, involves connecting the aorta to the left ventricle\\nand connecting the pulmonary artery to the right ventri-\\ncle. Balloon atrial septostomy, also done to correct trans-\\nposition of the great arteries, enlarges the atrial opening\\nduring heart catheterization. Balloon valvuloplasty uses a\\nballoon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heart valve,\\nimproving the flow of blood in pulmonary stenosis. It is\\nsometimes used in aortic stenosis. Transposition of the\\ngreat arteries can also be corrected by the Damus-Kaye-\\nStansel procedure, in which the pulmonary artery is cut\\nin two and connected to the ascending aorta and the far-\\nthest section of the right ventricle.\\nFor tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia, the\\nFontan procedure connects the right atrium to the pul-\\nmonary artery directly or with a conduit, and the atrial\\ndefect is closed. Pulmonary artery banding, narrowing\\nthe pulmonary artery with a band to reduce blood flow\\nand pressure in the lungs, is used for ventricular septal\\ndefect, atrioventricular canal defect, and tricuspid atresia.\\nLater, the band can be removed and the defect corrected\\nwith open-heart surgery.\\nTo correct aortic stenosis, the Ross procedure grafts\\nthe pulmonary artery to the aorta. For tetralogy of Fallot,\\ntricuspid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt proce-\\ndure creates a passage between blood vessels, sending\\nblood into parts of the body that need it. For transposi-\\ntion of the great arteries, venous switch creates a tunnel\\ninside the atria to re-direct oxygen-rich blood to the right\\nventricle and aorta and venous blood to the left ventricle\\nand pulmonary artery.\\nWhen all other options fail, some patients may need\\na heart transplant.

Other\\nnames for conjunctivitis include pink eye and red eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nConjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection,\\nsuch as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or disease\\nsuch as measles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp-\\ntoms include mild to severe discomfort in one or both\\neyes, redness, swelling of the eyelids, and watery, yellow,\\nor green discharge. Symptoms may last anywhere from\\nseveral days to two weeks. Infection with an adenovirus,\\nhowever, may also cause a significant amount of pus-like\\ndischarge and a scratchy, foreign body-type of sensation\\nin the eye. This may also be accompanied by swelling\\nand tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear.\\nBacterial conjunctivitis can occur in adults and chil-\\ndren and is caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus,\\nStreptococcus , and Hemophilus . Symptoms of bacterial\\nconjunctivitis include a pus-like discharge and crusty\\neyelids after awakening. Redness of the conjunctiva can\\nbe mild to severe and may be accompanied by swelling.\\nPersons with symptoms of conjunctivitis who are sexual-\\nly active may possibly be infected with the bacteria that\\ncause either gonorrhea or chlamydia. There may be\\nlarge amounts of pus-like discharge, and symptoms may\\ninclude intolerance to light (photophobia), watery\\nmucous discharge, and tenderness in the lymph nodes\\nnear the ear that may persist for up to three months.\\nConjunctivitis may also be caused by environmental\\nhazards, such as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac-\\ntions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms range\\nfrom itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons\\nwho wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc-\\ntivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreign\\nproteins contained in them.\\nOther less common causes of conjunctivitis include\\nexposure to sun lamps or the electrical arcs used during\\nwelding, and problems with inadequate drainage of the\\ntear ducts.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn accurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on\\ntaking a patient history to learn when symptoms began,\\nhow long the condition has been going on, the symptoms\\nexperienced, and other predisposing factors, such as\\nupper respiratory complaints,allergies, sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases, herpes simplex infections, and exposure\\nto persons with pink eye. It may be helpful to learn\\nwhether an aspect of an individual’s occupation may be\\nthe cause, for example, welding. Diagnostic tests are usu-\\nally not indicated unless initial treatment fails or an infec-\\ntion with gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. In such\\ncases, the discharge may be cultured and Gram stained to\\ndetermine the organism responsible for causing the condi-\\ntion. Cultures and smears are relatively painless.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of conjunctivitis depends on what\\ncaused the condition. In all cases, warm compresses\\napplied to the affected eye several times a day may help\\nto reduce discomfort.\\nConjunctivitis due to a viral infection, particularly\\nthose due to adenoviruses, are usually treated by applying\\nwarm compresses to the eye(s) and applying topical antibi-\\notic ointments to prevent secondary bacterial infections.\\nViral conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex should\\nbe referred to an ophthalmologist.

As with any of the recom-\\nmended treatments, however, if no improvement is seen\\nwithin 48–72 hours, a physician should be consulted.\\nHomeopathically, there are a number of acute reme-\\ndies designed to treat conjunctivitis. These include Pul-\\nsatilla (windflower, Pulsatilla nigricans ), Belladonna ,\\nand eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ). Eye drops, pre-\\npared with homeopathic remedies and/or herbs, can be a\\ngood substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops. Eye washes\\ncan also be made. Herbal eyewashes made with eyebright\\n(1 tsp. dried herb steeped in 1 pint of boiling water) or\\nchamomile (Matricaria recutita; 2–3 tsp in 1 pt of boiling\\nwater) may be helpful. Eyewashes should be strained and\\ncooled before use, and close attention should be paid to\\nmake sure that any solution put into the eye is sterile.\\nOther simple home remedies may help relieve the\\ndiscomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acid\\neyewash can be used to clean and soothe the eyes. A\\nwarm compress applied to the eyes for five to 10 minutes\\nthree times a day can help relieve the discomfort of bac-\\nterial and viral conjunctivitis. A cool compress or cool,\\ndamp tea bags placed on the eyes can ease the discomfort\\nof allergic conjunctivitis.\\nPrognosis\\nIf treated properly, the prognosis for conjunctivitis is\\ngood. Conjunctivitis caused by an allergic reaction\\nshould clear up once the allergen is removed. However,\\nallergic conjunctivitis will likely recur if the individual\\nagain comes into contact with the particular allergen.\\nConjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus, if treated\\nproperly, is usually resolved in 10–14 days. If there is no\\nrelief of symptoms in 48–72 hours, or there is moderate\\nto severe eye pain, changes in vision, or the conjunctivi-\\ntis is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex, a physi-\\ncian should be notified immediately. If untreated or if\\ntreatment fails and is not corrected, conjunctivitis may\\ncause visual impairment by spreading to other parts of\\nthe eye, such as the cornea.\\nPrevention\\nConjunctivitis can, in many cases, be prevented, or\\nat least the course of the disease can be shortened by fol-\\nlowing some simple practices.\\n• Frequently wash hands using antiseptic soap, and use\\nsingle-use towels during the disease to prevent spread-\\ning the infection.\\n• Avoid chemical irritants and known allergens.\\n• If in an area where welding occurs, use the proper pro-\\ntective eye wear and screens to prevent damaging the\\neyes.\\n• Use a clean tissue to remove discharge from eyes, and\\nwash hands to prevent the spread of infection.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n904\\nConjunctivitis\\nEyelid\\nConjunctiva\\nCornea\\nLens\\nConjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva, a thin,\\ndelicate membrane that covers the eyeball and lines the\\neyelid.

The doc-\\ntor uses his fingers to see if there is a hardened mass in\\nthe abdomen, and may perform a rectal examination .\\nOther diagnostic procedures include a barium enema ,\\nwhich reveals blockage inside the intestine; laboratory\\nanalysis of blood and stool samples for internal bleeding\\nor other symptoms of systemic disease; and a sigmoi-\\ndoscopy (examination of the sigmoid area of the colon\\nwith a flexible tube equipped with a magnifying lens).\\nPhysical and psychological assessments and a\\ndetailed history of bowel habits are especially important\\nwhen an elderly person complains of constipation.\\nTreatment\\nIf changes in diet and activity fail to relieve occa-\\nsional constipation, an over-the-counter laxative may be\\nused for a few days. Preparations that soften stools or add\\nbulk (bran, psyllium) work more slowly but are safer\\nthan Epsom salts and other harsh laxatives or herbal lax-\\natives containing senna ( Cassia senna ) or buckthorn\\n(Rhamnus purshianna ), which can harm the nerves and\\nlining of the colon.\\nA woman who is pregnant should never use a laxa-\\ntive. Neither should anyone who is experiencing abdomi-\\nnal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\\nA warm-water or mineral oil enema can relieve con-\\nstipation, and a non-digestible sugar (lactulose) or spe-\\ncial electrolyte solution is recommended for adults and\\nolder children with stubborn symptoms.\\nIf a patient has an impacted bowel, the doctor inserts\\na gloved finger into the rectum and gently dislodges the\\nhardened feces.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n906\\nConstipation'),\n",

There\\nare two kinds of contact dermatitis, irritant and allergic.\\nDescription\\nThousands of natural and man-made substances can\\ncause contact dermatitis, which is the most common skin\\ncondition requiring medical attention and the foremost\\nsource of work-related disease. Florists, domestic work-\\ners, hairdressers, food preparers, and employees in\\nindustry, construction, and health care are the people\\nmost at risk of contracting work-related contact dermati-\\ntis. Americans spend roughly $300 million a year in their\\nquest for relief from contact dermatitis, not counting the\\nconsiderable sums devoted by governments and business-\\nes to regulating and policing the use of skin-threatening\\nchemicals in the workplace. But exactly how many peo-\\nple suffer from contact dermatitis remains unclear; a 1997\\narticle in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-\\ntion notes that figures ranging from 1% to 15% have been\\nput forward for Western industrial nations.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIrritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is the more com-\\nmonly reported of the two kinds of contact dermatitis,\\nand is seen in about 80% of cases. It can be caused by\\nsoaps, detergents, solvents, adhesives, fiberglass, and\\nother substances that are able to directly injure the skin.\\nMost attacks are slight and confined to the hands and\\nforearms, but can affect any part of the body that comes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2908\\nContact dermatitis'),\n",

The symptoms\\ncan take many forms: redness,itching , crusting,\\nswelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken-\\ning of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of con-\\ntact. In extreme cases, severe blistering can occur and\\nopen sores can form. Jobs that require frequent skin\\nexposure to water, such as hairdressing and food prepara-\\ntion, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when\\nrepeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-\\nstance) triggers an immune response that inflames the\\nskin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,\\nfood additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-\\nstances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewer\\nthan 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACD\\ncases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,\\nand poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet-\\nics and personal care products; latex items such as gloves\\nand condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find that\\nthey are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACD\\nis usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contact\\nwith the allergen, typically the hands or face. Symptoms\\nrange from mild to severe and resemble those of ICD; a\\npatch test may be needed to determine which kind of con-\\ntact dermatitis a person is suffering from.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a physical examination and\\nasking the patient questions about his or her health and\\ndaily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, the\\ndoctor attempts to learn as much as possible about the\\npatient’s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medications\\nand cosmetics, etc.—anything that might shed light on\\nthe source of the disease. In some cases, an examination\\nof the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitis\\nis mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur,\\nordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficult\\ncases require patch testing to identify the allergen.\\nTwo methods of patch testing are currently used. The\\nmost widely used method, the Finn chamber method,\\nemploys a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filled\\nwith a small amount of the allergen being tested and the\\npatch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s upper back.\\nAfter 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial reading\\nis taken. A second reading is made a few days later. The\\nsecond method of patch testing involves applying a small\\namount of the test substance to directly to normal skin\\nand covering it with a dressing that keeps air out and\\nkeeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48\\nhours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction has\\noccurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeated\\ntesting, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc-\\ncessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD,\\nthough it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD.\\nTreatment\\nThe best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify\\nthe allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con-\\ntact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid-\\nance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as an\\nallergy to an essential workplace chemical for which no\\nsubstitute can be found, avoidance may be impossible or\\nforce the sufferer to find new work or make other drastic\\nchanges in his or her life. Barrier creams and protective\\nclothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts are\\nways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance is\\nimpossible, though they are not always effective.\\nFor the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild\\ncases include cool compresses and nonprescription\\nlotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe,\\ncorticosteroidsapplied to the skin or taken orally are\\nused. Contact dermatitis that leads to a bacterial skin\\ninfection is treated with antibiotics.\\nAlternative treatment\\nHerbal remedies have been used for centuries to\\ntreat skin disorders including contact dermatitis.

There are different kinds of\\nbirth control that act at different points in the process.\\nPurpose\\nEvery month, a woman’s body begins the process\\nthat can potentially lead to pregnancy. An egg (ovum)\\nmatures, the mucus that is secreted by the cervix (a cylin-\\ndrical-shaped organ at the lower end of the uterus)\\nchanges to be more inviting to sperm, and the lining of\\nthe uterus grows in preparation for receiving a fertilized\\negg. Any woman who wants to prevent pregnancy must\\nuse a reliable form of birth control.\\nBirth control (contraception) is designed to interfere\\nwith the normal process and prevent the pregnancy that\\ncould result. There are different kinds of birth control\\nthat act at different points in the process, from ovulation,\\nthrough fertilization, to implantation. Each method has\\nits own side effects and risks. Some methods are more\\nreliable than others.\\nAlthough there are many different types of birth\\ncontrol, they can be divided into a few groups based on\\nhow they work. These groups include:\\n• Hormonal methods—These use medications (hor-\\nmones) to prevent ovulation. Hormonal methods\\ninclude birth control pills (oral contraceptives), Depo\\nProvera injections and Norplant.\\n• Barrier methods—These methods work by preventing\\nthe sperm from getting to and fertilizing the egg. Barri-\\ner methods include the condom, diaphragm, and cervi-\\ncal cap. The condom is the only form of birth control\\nthat also protects against sexually transmitted dis-\\neases, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).\\n• Spermicides—These medications kill sperm on con-\\ntact. Most spermicides contain nonoxynyl-9. Spermi-\\ncides come in many different forms such as jelly, foam,\\ntablets, and even a transparent film. All are placed in\\nthe vagina. Spermicides work best when they are used\\nat the same time as a barrier method.\\n• Intrauterine devices—Intrauterine contraceptive\\ndevices (IUDs) are inserted into the uterus, where they\\nstay from one to 10 years. An IUD prevents the fertil-\\nized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus, and\\nmay have other effects as well.\\n• Tubal sterilization—Tubal sterilization is a permanent\\nform of contraception for women. Each fallopian tube\\nis either tied or burned closed. The sperm cannot reach\\nthe egg, and the egg cannot travel to the uterus.\\n• Vasectomy—is the male form of sterilization, and\\nshould also be considered permanent. In vasectomy ,\\nthe vas defrens, the tiny tubes that carry the sperm into\\nthe semen, are cut and tied off. Thus, no sperm can get\\ninto the semen.\\nUnfortunately, there is no perfect form of birth con-\\ntrol. Only abstinence (not having sexual intercourse) can\\nprotect against unwanted pregnancy with 100% reliability.\\nThe failure rates, which means the rates of pregnancy, for\\nmost forms of birth control are quite low. However, some\\nforms of birth control are more difficult or inconvenient to\\nuse than others. In actual practice, the birth control meth-\\nods that are more difficult or inconvenient have much\\nhigher failure rates because they are not used faithfully.\\nDescription\\nAll the different forms of birth control have one thing\\nin common.

All other methods of birth control must be\\nworking all the time to provide protection (hormonal\\nmethods, IUDs, tubal sterilization).\\nPrecautions\\nThere are risks associated with some forms of birth\\ncontrol. Some of the risks of each method are listed\\nbelow:\\n• Birth control pills—The hormone (estrogen) in birth\\ncontrol pills can increase the risk of heart attack in\\nwomen over 40 who smoke.\\n• IUD—The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic\\ninfection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by poking\\ninto or through the uterine wall.

In addition, it may take many months to\\nbegin ovulating again once a woman stops using Depo\\nProvera or Norplant.\\n• Barrier methods—A woman must insert the diaphragm\\nin just the right way to be sure that it works properly.\\nSome women get more urinary tract infections if they\\nuse a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm can\\npress against the urethra, the tube that connects the\\nbladder to the outside.\\n• Spermicides—Some women and men are allergic to\\nspermicides or find them irritating to the skin.\\n• IUD—The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the\\nuterus, and the uterus tries to get it out.

These non-bony\\ntissues include muscles, ligaments, and tendons.\\nDescription\\nContractures can occur at any joint of the body. This\\njoint dysfunction may be a result of immobilization from\\ninjury or disease; nerve injury, such as spinal cord dam-\\nage and stroke; or muscle, tendon, or ligament disease.\\nKEY TERMS\\nFallopian tubes —The thin tubes that connect the\\novary to the uterus. Ova (eggs) travel from the\\novary to the uterus. If the egg has been fertilized, it\\ncan implant in the uterus.\\nFertilization—The joining of the sperm and the\\negg; conception.\\nImplantation—The process in which the fertilized\\negg embeds itself in the wall of the uterus.\\nOvulation—The release of an egg (ovum) from the\\novary.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are a number of pathologies and diseases that\\ncan lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result-\\ning in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance,pain,\\nprolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of the\\nfrequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is\\nthe most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptoms\\ninclude a significant loss of motion to any specific joint\\nthat results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif-\\nicant degree, pain can result even without any voluntary\\njoint movement.\\nDiagnosis\\nManual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro-\\nfessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. a\\nphysical therapist) will identify indications of restricted\\nstructures within the joint. Measuring the motion of the\\njoint with a device termed a “goniometer” can be useful\\nif the decrease of motion can be shown to be a proven\\nresult of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene-\\nfit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visible\\ndecrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contracted\\njoint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after a\\nthorough physical examination involving physical and\\nmanual testing of the joint motion.\\nTreatment\\nManual techniques\\nJoint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a\\ncommon technique used to increase joint elasticity.\\nStructures are stretched in similar directions to those\\nwhich take place upon normal joint motion. Some\\nhealthcare professionals may use some form of heat prior\\nto the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate,exer-\\ncise may follow manual techniques to help maintain the\\nadditional motion achieved.\\nMechanical techniques\\nDevices known as continuous passive motion\\nmachines are very popular, especially following surgery\\nof joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM)\\nare specifically adjusted to each individual’s need. This\\nmethod is administered within the first 24–72 hours after\\nthe injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically moved\\nthrough the patient’s tolerable motion. CPM machines\\nhave been proved to accelerate the return motion process,\\nallowing patients more function in less time.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n913\\nContractures'),\n",

In fact, about 85% of patients diagnosed\\nwith cor pulmonale have COPD. Chronic bronchitis and\\nemphysema are types of COPD.

In addition\\nto COPD, cor pulmonale may also be caused by lung dis-\\neases, such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, and\\npneumoconiosis.

Cain, CRA, Custom Medical Stock Photo.\\nReproduced by permission.)\\nCori’s disease see Glycogen storage\\ndiseases\\nCorkscrew esophagus see Diffuse\\nesophageal spasm\\nCorneal abrasion\\nDefinition\\nA corneal abrasion is a worn or scraped-off area of\\nthe outer, clear layer of the eye (cornea).\\nDescription\\nThe cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer area of\\nthe eye. It lies in front of the colored part of the eye (iris)\\nand the black hole in the iris (pupil). The outermost layer\\nof the eyeball consists of the cornea and the white part of\\nthe eye (sclera). A corneal abrasion is basically a superfi-\\ncial cut or scrape on the cornea. A corneal abrasion is not\\nas serious as a corneal ulcer, which is generally deeper\\nand more severe than an abrasion.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA corneal abrasion is usually the result of direct injury\\nto the eye, often from a fingernail scratch, makeup brushes,\\ncontact lenses, foreign body, or even twigs. Patients often\\ncomplain of feeling a foreign body in their eye, and they\\nmay have pain, sensitivity to light, or tearing.\\nDiagnosis\\nOphthalmologists and optometrists, who treat eye\\ndisorders, are well qualified to diagnose corneal abra-\\nsions. The doctor will check the patient’s vision (visual\\nacuity) in both eyes with an eye chart. A patient history\\nwill also be taken, which may help to determine the\\ncause of the abrasion. A slit lamp, which is basically a\\nmicroscope and light source, will allow the doctor to see\\nthe abrasion. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be placed\\ninto the eye to determine the extent of the abrasion. The\\nfluorescein will temporarily stain the affected area.\\nTreatment\\nThe cornea has a remarkable ability to heal itself, so\\ntreatment is designed to minimize complications. If the\\nabrasion is very small, the doctor might just suggest an\\neye lubricant and a follow-up visit the next day. A very\\nsmall abrasion should heal in one to two days; others\\nusually in one week. However, to avoid a possible infec-\\ntion, an antibiotic eye drop may be prescribed. Some-\\ntimes additional eye drops may make the eye feel more\\ncomfortable. Depending upon the extent of the abrasion,\\nsome doctors may patch the affected eye. It is very\\nimportant to go for the follow-up checkup to make sure\\nan infection does not occur. Use of contact lenses should\\nnot be resumed without the doctor’s approval.\\nPrognosis\\nIn typical cases, the prognosis is good. The cornea\\nwill heal itself, usually within several days. A very deep\\nabrasion may lead to scarring. If the abrasion does not\\nheal properly, a recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) may\\nresult months or even years later. The symptoms are the\\nsame as for an abrasion (e.g., tearing, foreign body sensa-\\ntion, and blurred vision), but it will keep occurring. Simi-\\nlar or additional treatment for the RCE may be necessary.\\nPrevention\\nEveryone should wear eye protection whenever this\\nis recommended. This should be standard practice when\\nusing power tools and playing certain sports. Goggles\\nshould even be worn when mowing the lawn, because a\\ntwig can be thrown upward toward the face. Contact lens\\nwearers should be careful to follow their doctors’ instruc-\\ntions on caring for and wearing their lenses. Ill-fitting or\\ndirty lenses could lead to an abrasion, so patients should\\ngo for their prescribed checkups.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n918\\nCorneal abrasion'),\n",

Lampert\\nCorneal infection see Keratitis\\nCorneal keratoplasty see Corneal\\ntransplantation\\nCorneal transplantation\\nDefinition\\nIn corneal transplant, also known as keratoplasty, a\\npatient’s damaged cornea is replaced by the cornea from\\nthe eye of a human cadaver. This is the single most com-\\nmon type of human transplant surgery and has the high-\\nest success rate. Eye banks acquire and store eyes from\\ndonor individuals largely to supply the need for trans-\\nplant corneas.\\nPurpose\\nCorneal transplant is used when vision is lost in an\\neye because the cornea has been damaged by disease or\\ntraumatic injury. Some of the disease conditions that\\nmight require corneal transplant include the bulging out-\\nward of the cornea (keratoconus), a malfunction of the\\ninner layer of the cornea (Fuchs’ dystrophy), and painful\\nswelling of the cornea (pseudophakic bullous keratopa-\\nthy). Some of these conditions cause cloudiness of the\\ncornea; others alter its natural curvature, which can also\\nreduce the quality of vision.\\nInjury to the cornea can occur because of chemical\\nburns, mechanical trauma, or infection by viruses, bacte-\\nria, fungi, or protozoa. The herpes virus produces one of\\nthe more common infections leading to corneal transplant.\\nSurgery would only be used when damage to the\\ncornea is too severe to be treated with corrective lenses.\\nOccasionally, corneal transplant is combined with other\\ntypes of eye surgery (such as cataract surgery) to solve\\nmultiple eye problems in one procedure.\\nPrecautions\\nCorneal transplant is a very safe procedure that can\\nbe performed on almost any patient who would benefit\\nfrom it. Any active infection or inflammation of the eye\\nusually needs to be brought under control before surgery\\ncan be performed.\\nDescription\\nThe cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the\\nvery front of the eye. It is composed almost entirely of a\\nspecial type of collagen. It normally contains no blood\\nvessels, but because it contains nerve endings, damage to\\nthe cornea can be very painful.\\nIn a corneal transplant, a disc of tissue is removed\\nfrom the center of the eye and replaced by a correspond-\\ning disc from a donor eye. The circular incision is made\\nusing an instrument called a trephine. In one form of\\ncorneal transplant (penetrating keratoplasty), the disc\\nremoved is the entire thickness of the cornea and so is the\\nreplacement disc. Over 90% of all corneal transplants in\\nthe United States are of this type. In lamellar keratoplas-\\nty, on the other hand, only the outer layer of the cornea is\\nremoved and replaced.\\nThe donor cornea is attached with extremely fine\\nsutures. Surgery can be performed under anesthesia that is\\nconfined to one area of the body while the patient is\\nawake (local anesthesia) or under anesthesia that places\\nthe entire body of the patient in a state of unconsciousness\\n(general anesthesia.) Surgery requires 30–90 minutes.\\nOver 40,000 corneal transplants are performed in the\\nUnited States each year.

The patient\\nmay also be asked to skip breakfast on the day of surgery.\\nAftercare\\nCorneal transplant is often performed on an outpa-\\ntient basis, although some patients need brief hospitaliza-\\ntion after surgery. The patient will wear an eye patch at\\nleast overnight. An eye shield or glasses must be worn to\\nprotect the eye until the surgical wound has healed. Eye\\ndrops will be prescribed for the patient to use for several\\nweeks after surgery.

Treatment requires penetrating\\nkeratoplasty. The lens of the eye may also be affect-\\ned and require surgical replacement at the same\\ntime as the cornea.\\nGlaucoma—A vision defect caused when excessive\\nfluid pressure within the eye damages the optic\\nnerve.\\nHistocompatibility antigens—Proteins scattered\\nthroughout body tissues that are unique for almost\\nevery individual.\\nKeratoconus—An eye condition in which the\\ncornea bulges outward, interfering with normal\\nvision. Usually both eyes are affected.\\nPseudophakic bullous keratopathy—Painful\\nswelling of the cornea occasionally occurring after\\nsurgery to implant an artificial lens in place of a\\nlens affected by cataract.\\nRetinal detachment—A serious vision disorder in\\nwhich the light-detecting layer of cells inside the\\neye (retina) is separated from its normal support tis-\\nsue and no longer functions properly.\\nTrephine—A small surgical instrument that is rotat-\\ned to cut a circular incision.\\nFor the first few days after surgery, the eye may feel\\nscratchy and irritated. Vision will be somewhat blurry for\\nas long as several months.\\nSutures are often left in place for six months, and\\noccasionally for as long as two years.\\nRisks\\nCorneal transplants are highly successful, with over\\n90% of operations in United States achieving restoration\\nof sight. However, there is always some risk associated\\nwith any surgery. Complications that can occur include\\ninfection,glaucoma, retinal detachment , cataract for-\\nmation, and rejection of the donor cornea.\\nGraft rejection occurs in 5–30% of patients, a com-\\nplication possible with any procedure involving tissue\\ntransplantation from another person (allograft). Allograft\\nrejection results from a reaction of the patient’s immune\\nsystem to the donor tissue. Cell surface proteins called\\nhistocompatibility antigens trigger this reaction. These\\nantigens are often associated with vascular tissue (blood\\nvessels) within the graft tissue. Since the cornea normal-\\nly contains no blood vessels, it experiences a very low\\nrate of rejection. Generally, blood typing and tissue typ-\\ning are not needed in corneal transplants, and no close\\nmatch between donor and recipient is required.

Infection\\nand injury cause inflammation of the cornea—a condi-\\ntion called keratitis . Tissue loss because of inflamma-\\ntion produces an ulcer. The ulcer can either be centrally\\nlocated, thus greatly affecting vision, or peripherally\\nlocated. There are about 30,000 cases of bacterial corneal\\nulcers in the United States each year.\\nDescription\\nThe most common cause of corneal ulcers is germs,\\nbut most of them cannot invade a healthy cornea with\\nadequate tears and a functioning eyelid. They gain access\\nbecause injury has impaired these defense mechanisms.\\nA direct injury from a foreign object inoculates germs\\ndirectly through the outer layer of the cornea, just as it\\ndoes to the skin. A caustic chemical can inflame the\\ncornea by itself or so damage it that germs can invade.\\nImproper use of contact lenses has become a common\\ncause of corneal injury. Eyelid or tear function failure is\\nthe other way to make the eye vulnerable to infection.\\nTears and the eyelid together wash the eye and prevent\\nforeign material from settling in. Tears contain enzymes\\nand other substances to help protect against infection.\\nCertain diseases dry up tear production, leaving the\\ncornea dry and defenseless. Other diseases paralyze or\\nweaken the eyelids so that they cannot effectively protect\\nand cleanse the eyes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nViruses, bacteria, fungi, and a protozoan called\\nAcanthamoeba can all invade the cornea and damage it\\nunder suitable conditions.\\n• Bacteria from a common conjunctivitis (pink eye)\\nrarely spread to the cornea, but can if untreated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n921\\nCorneal ulcers\\nA close-up view of an ulcer on cornea.(Custom Medical\\nStock Photo.

One form of chlamydial infection is the leading\\ncause of blindness in developing countries and is known\\nas Egyptian ophthalmia or trachoma. Another type of\\nChlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease.\\n• Other sexually transmitted diseases—for example,\\nsyphilis—can affect the cornea.\\nThe most common viruses to damage the cornea are\\nadenoviruses and herpes viruses. Viral and fungal infec-\\ntions are often caused by improper use of topical corti-\\ncosteroids. If topical corticosteroids are used in a patient\\nwith herpes simplex keratitis, the ulcer can get much\\nworse and blindness could result.\\nSymptoms are obvious. The cornea is intensely sen-\\nsitive, so corneal ulcers normally produce severe pain. If\\nthe corneal ulcer is centrally located, vision is impaired\\nor completely absent. Tearing is present and the eye is\\nred. It hurts to look at bright lights.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe doctor will take a case history to try to deter-\\nmine the cause of the ulcer. This can include improper\\nuse of contact lenses; injury, such as a scratch from a\\ntwig; or severe dry eye. An instrument called a slit lamp\\nwill be used to examine the cornea. The slit lamp is a\\nmicroscope with a light source that magnifies the cornea,\\nallowing the extent of the ulcer to be seen. Fluorescein, a\\nyellow dye, may be used to illuminate further detail. If a\\ngerm is responsible for the ulcer, identification may\\nrequire scraping samples directly from the cornea, con-\\njunctiva, and lids, and sending them to the laboratory.\\nKEY TERMS\\nFluorescein —A fluorescent chemical used to\\nexamine the cornea.\\nGerm—A disease-causing microorganism.\\nInflammation—The body’s reaction to irritation.\\nTopical corticosteroids —Cortisone and related\\ndrugs used on the skin and in the eye, usually for\\nallergic conditions.\\nTreatment\\nA corneal ulcer needs to be treated aggressively, as it\\ncan result in loss of vision. The first step is to eliminate\\ninfection. Broad spectrum antibiotics will be used\\nbefore the lab results come back. Medications may then\\nbe changed to more specifically target the cause of the\\ninfection. A combination of medications may be neces-\\nsary. Patients should return for their follow-up visits so\\nthat the doctor can monitor the healing process. The\\ncornea can heal from many insults, but if it remains\\nscarred,corneal transplantation may be necessary to\\nrestore vision. If the corneal ulcer is large, hospitaliza-\\ntion may be necessary.\\nPrognosis\\nTreated early enough, corneal infections will usually\\nresolve, perhaps even without the formation of an ulcer.\\nHowever, left untreated, infections can lead to ulcers and\\nthe corneal ulcer can result in scarring or perforation of\\nthe cornea. Other problems may occur as well, including\\nglaucoma. Patients with certain systemic diseases that\\nimpede healing (such as diabetes mellitus or rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis) may need more aggressive treatment. The\\nlater the treatment, the more damage will be done and the\\nmore scarring will result. Corneal transplant is standard\\ntreatment with a high probability of success.\\nPrevention\\nAttentive care of contact lenses will greatly reduce\\nthe incidence of corneal damage and ulceration. Germs\\nthat cause no problems in the mouth or on the hands can\\ndamage the eye, so contact lens wearers must wash their\\nhands before touching their lenses and must not use sali-\\nva to moisten them. Tap water should not be used to rinse\\nthe lenses. Contacts should be removed whenever there\\nis irritation and left out until the eyes are back to normal.\\nIt is not advisable to wear contact lenses while swim-\\nming or in hot tubs. Daily wear contact lenses have been\\nfound to be less of a risk than contacts for overnight wear\\n(extended wear). Organisms have been cultured from\\ncontact lens cases, so the cases should be rinsed in hot\\nwater and allowed to air dry. Cases should be replaced\\nevery three months. Patients should follow their doctors’\\nschedules for replacement of the contacts.\\nEye protection in the workplace, or wherever tiny\\nparticles are flying around, is essential. Ultraviolet (UV)\\ncoatings on glasses or sunglasses can help protect the\\neyes from the sun’s rays.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\\nCorns and calluses\\nDefinition\\nA corn is a small, painful, raised bump on the outer\\nskin layer. A callus is a rough, thickened patch of skin.\\nDescription\\nCorns and calluses are one of the three major foot\\nproblems in the United States. The other two are foot\\ninfections and toenail problems. Corns and calluses\\naffect about 5% of the population.\\nCorns usually appear on non-weight-bearing areas\\nlike the outside of the little toe or the tops of other toes.\\nWomen have corns more often than men, probably\\nbecause women wear high-heeled shoes and other shoes\\nthat do not fit properly. Corns have hard cores shaped\\nlike inverted pyramids. Sharp pain occurs whenever\\ndownward pressure is applied, and a dull ache may be\\nfelt at other times.\\nCalluses occur most often on the heels and balls of\\nthe feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. However,\\nthey can develop on any part of the body that is subject to\\nrepeated pressure or irritation. Calluses are usually more\\nthan an inch wide—larger than corns. They generally\\ndon’t hurt unless pressure is applied.\\nTypes of corns\\nA hard corn is a compact lump with a thick core.\\nHard corns usually form on the tops of the toes, on the\\noutside of the little toe, or on the sole of the foot.\\nA soft corn is a small, inflamed patch of skin with a\\nsmooth center. Soft corns usually appear between the toes.\\nA seed corn is the least common type of corn.\\nOccurring only on the heel or ball of the foot, a seed corn\\nconsists of a circle of stiff skin surrounding a plug of\\ncholesterol.\\nTypes of calluses\\nA plantar callus, a callus that occurs on the sole of\\nthe foot, has a white center. Hereditary calluses develop\\nwhere there is no apparent friction, run in families, and\\noccur most often in children.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCorns and calluses form to prevent injury to skin\\nthat is repeatedly pinched, rubbed, or irritated. The most\\ncommon causes are:\\n• shoes that are too tight or too loose, or have very high\\nheels\\n• tight socks or stockings\\n• deformed toes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n923\\nCorns and calluses\\nCorns on toes.

Corns may be extremely sore\\nand surrounded by inflamed, swollen skin.\\nDiagnosis\\nCorns can be recognized on sight. A family physi-\\ncian or podiatrist may scrape skin off what seems to be a\\ncallus, but may actually be a wart. If the lesion is a wart,\\nit will bleed. A callus will not bleed, but will reveal\\nanother layer of dead skin.\\nTreatment\\nCorns and calluses do not usually require medical\\nattention unless the person who has them has diabetes\\nmellitus , poor circulation, or other problems that make\\nself-care difficult.\\nTreatment should begin as soon as an abnormality\\nappears. The first step is to identify and eliminate the\\nsource of pressure. Placing moleskin pads over corns can\\nrelieve pressure, and large wads of cotton, lamb’s wool,\\nor moleskin can cushion calluses.\\nUsing hydrocortisone creams or soaking feet in a\\nsolution of Epsom salts and very warm water for at least\\nfive minutes a day before rubbing the area with a pumice\\nstone will remove part or all of some calluses. Rubbing\\ncorns just makes them hurt more.\\nApplying petroleum jelly or lanolin-enriched hand\\nlotion helps keep skin soft, but corn-removing ointments\\nthat contain acid can damage healthy skin. They should\\nnever be used by pregnant women or by people who are\\ndiabetic or who have poor circulation.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAyurveda—Ayurveda is a system of wholistic\\nmedicine from India that aims to bring the individ-\\nual into harmony with nature. It provides guid-\\nance regarding food and lifestyle, so that healthy\\npeople can stay healthy and people with health\\nchallenges can improve their health.\\nBursitis—Inflammation of a bursa, a fluid-filled\\ncavity or sac. In the body, bursae are located at\\nplaces where friction might otherwise develop.\\nIt is important to see a doctor if the skin of a corn or\\ncallus is cut, because it may become infected. If a corn\\ndischarges pus or clear fluid, it is infected. A family\\nphysician, podiatrist, or orthopedist may:\\n• remove (debride) affected layers of skin\\n• prescribe oral antibiotics to eliminate infection\\n• drain pus from infected corns\\n• inject cortisone into the affected area to decrease pain\\nor inflammation\\n• perform surgery to correct toe deformities or remove\\nbits of bone\\nAlternative treatment\\nStanding and walking correctly can sometimes elim-\\ninate excess foot pressure. Several types of bodywork\\ncan help correct body imbalances. Bodywork is a term\\nused for any of a number of systems, including Aston-\\nPatterning , the Feldenkrais method , and rolfing, that\\nmanipulate the body through massage, movement educa-\\ntion, or meditational techniques.\\nAloe (Aloe barbadensis ) cream is an effective skin\\nsoftener, and two or three daily applications of calendu-\\nla (Calendula officinalis ) salve can soften skin and pre-\\nvent inflammation. One teaspoon of lemon juice mixed\\nwith one teaspoon of dried chamomile (Martricaria\\nrecutita ) tea and one crushed garlic clove dissolves\\nthickened skin.\\nAn ayurvedic practitioner may recommend the fol-\\nlowing treatment:\\n• apply each day a paste made by combining one tea-\\nspoon of aloe vera gel with half that amount of turmeric\\n(Circuma longa)\\n• bandage overnight\\n• soak in warm water for 10 minutes every morning\\n• massage gently with mustard (Brassica cruciferae) oil\\nPrognosis\\nMost corns and calluses disappear about three weeks\\nafter the pressure that caused them is eliminated. They\\nare apt to recur if the pressure returns.\\nExtreme pain can change the way a person stands or\\nwalks. Such changes can, in turn, cause pain in the ankle,\\nback, hip, or knee.\\nBursitis , a painful, inflamed fluid-filled sac, can\\ndevelop beneath a corn.

These grafts usually come from\\nthe patient’s own arteries and veins located in the leg,\\narm, or chest.\\nPurpose\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called\\ncoronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper-\\nation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart.\\nThis relieves chest pain and ischemia , improves the\\npatient’s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs the\\npatient’s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable the\\npatient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the risk\\nof a heart attack.\\nThe decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft\\nsurgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreement\\namong experts as to when it is indicated. Many experts\\nfeel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit-\\ned States. According to the American Heart Association,\\nappropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graft\\nsurgery include patients with blockages in at least three\\nmajor coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are in\\narteries that feed the heart’s left ventricle; patients with\\nanginaso severe that even mild exertion causes chest\\npain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans-\\nluminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to\\ndrug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary artery\\nbypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patients\\nwith severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis-\\neased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle).\\nPrecautions\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery should ideally\\nbe postponed for three months after a heart attack. Patients\\nshould be medically stable before the surgery, if possible.\\nDescription\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour\\naround one or more blocked coronary arteries with a\\ngraft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes around\\nthe clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathways\\nfor oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart.\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery\\nperformed in a hospital. The length of the procedure\\ndepends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but it\\ngenerally  takes from four to six hours—sometimes longer.\\nThe average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov-\\nery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three to\\nfour months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden-\\ntary office jobs can return to work; people with physical\\njobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers.\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per-\\nformed in the United States. The American Heart Associ-\\nation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graft\\nsurgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995.\\nSeventy-four percent of these procedures were per-\\nformed on men and 44% on men and women under the\\nage of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of this\\nprocedure in 1995 was $44,820.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n925\\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery'),\n",

After general anesthesia is adminis-\\ntered, the surgeon removes the veins or prepares the arter-\\nies for grafting. If the saphenous vein is to be used, a series\\nof incisions are made in the patient’s thigh or calf. More\\ncommonly, a segment of the internal mammary artery will\\nbe used and the incisions are made in the chest wall. The\\nsurgeon then makes an incision from the patient’s neck to\\nnavel, saws through the breastbone, and retracts the rib\\ncage open to expose the heart. The patient is connected to\\na heart-lung machine, also called a cardiopulmonary\\nbypass pump, that cools the body to reduce the need for\\noxygen and takes over for the heart and lungs during the\\nprocedure. The heart is then stopped and a cold solution of\\npotassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor-\\ntic root and the coronary arteries to lower the temperature\\nof the heart, which prevents damage to the tissue.\\nNext, a small opening is made just below the block-\\nage in the diseased coronary artery. Blood will be redirect-\\ned through this opening once the graft is sewn in place. If a\\nleg vein is used, one end is connected to the coronary\\nartery and the other to the aorta. If a mammary artery is\\nused, one end is connected to the coronary artery while the\\nother remains attached to the aorta. The procedure is\\nrepeated on as many coronary arteries as necessary. Most\\npatients who have coronary artery bypass graft surgery\\nhave at least three grafts done during the procedure.\\nElectric shocks start the heart pumping again after\\nthe grafts have been completed. The heart-lung machine\\nis turned off and the blood slowly returns to normal body\\ntemperature. After implanting pacing electrodes (if need-\\ned) and inserting a chest tube, the surgeon closes the\\nchest cavity.\\nSuccess rate of coronary artery bypass graft surgery\\nAbout 90% of patients experience significant improve-\\nments after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Patients who have poorer results from\\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery include those over the\\nage of 70, those who have poor left ventricular function, or\\nare undergoing a repeat surgery or other procedures con-\\ncurrently, and those who continue smoking, do not treat\\nhigh cholesterol or other coronary risk factors, or have\\nanother debilitating disease.\\nLong term, symptoms recur in only about 3–4% of\\npatients per year. Five years after coronary artery bypass\\ngraft surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years it is\\nabout 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 years it\\nis about 40%.\\nAngina recurs in about 40% of patients after about\\n10 years. In most cases, it is less severe than before the\\nsurgery and can be controlled by drug therapy. In patients\\nwho have had vein grafts, 40% of the grafts are severely\\nobstructed 10 years after the procedure. Repeat coronary\\nartery bypass graft surgery may be necessary, and is usu-\\nally less successful than the first surgery.\\nMinimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft\\nsurgery\\nThere are two new types of minimally invasive coro-\\nnary artery bypass graft surgery: port-access coronary\\nartery bypass (also called PACAB or PortCAB) and min-\\nimally invasive coronary artery bypass (also called MID-\\nCAB). These procedures are minimally invasive because\\nthey do not require the neck-to-navel incision, sawing\\nthrough the breastbone, or opening the rib cage to expose\\nthe heart. Both procedures enable surgeons to work on\\nthe coronary arteries through small chest holes called\\nports and other small incisions. Port-access coronary\\nartery bypass requires the use of a heart-lung machine\\nbut minimally invasive coronary artery bypass does not.\\nAdvantages of these procedures over standard coronary\\nartery bypass graft surgery include a shorter hospital\\nstay, a shorter recovery period, and lower costs.\\nPort-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons\\nto perform bypasses through smaller incisions. Using a\\nvideo monitor to view the procedure, the surgeon passes\\ninstruments through ports in the patient’s chest to per-\\nform the bypass. Mammary arteries or leg veins are used\\nfor the grafts. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass\\nis performed on a beating heart and is appropriate only\\nfor bypasses of one or two arteries. Small ports are made\\nin the patient’s chest, along with a small incision directly\\nover the coronary artery to be bypassed. Generally, the\\nsurgeon uses a mammary artery for the bypass.\\nEarly data on outcomes for port-access coronary artery\\nbypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are\\nfavorable. Mortality rates with port-access coronary artery\\nbypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are\\nboth less than 3%—about the same as in standard coronary\\nartery bypass graft surgery. One clinical trial indicated that\\nsurvival at seven years was the same in minimally invasive\\ncoronary artery bypass and standard coronary artery bypass\\ngraft surgery, but that another intervention was necessary\\nfive times more often with minimally invasive coronary\\nartery bypass than with standard coronary artery bypass\\ngraft surgery. The American Heart Association Council on\\nCardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery feels that both pro-\\ncedures appear promising but that further study is needed.\\nMore data covering longer term outcomes are necessary in\\norder to fully assess these procedures.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient is usually admitted to the hospital the\\nday before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery is\\nscheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously\\nperformed to show the surgeon where the arteries are\\nblocked and where the grafts might best be positioned.\\nThe patient is given a blood-thinning drug—usually\\nheparin—that helps to prevent blood clots. The evening\\nbefore the surgery, the patient showers with antiseptic\\nsoap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight,\\nfood and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed on\\nthe morning of surgery and sometimes the night before.\\nHeart monitoring begins.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit\\nfor at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she is\\nconnected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti-\\nlator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, and\\na urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator are\\nusually removed within six hours of surgery, but the other\\ntubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten-\\nsive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and to\\nprevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closely\\nmonitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heart\\nsounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial\\nblood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked to\\nensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra-\\nvenously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirinare\\nstarted within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chest\\nphysiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathing\\ntube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turning\\nfrequently, and taking deep breaths.

It is caused by atherosclerosis, an accu-\\nmulation of fatty materials on the inner linings of arter-\\nies. The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to the\\nheart. When the blood flow is completely cut off, the\\nresult is a heart attack.\\nDescription\\nCoronary artery disease, also called coronary heart\\ndisease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for\\nboth men and women in the United States. According to\\nthe American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8\\ndeaths in the United States was caused by coronary artery\\ndisease. About every 29 seconds, one American will have\\na heart attack; about every minute, one American will die\\nfrom a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans have\\nactive symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attack\\nor chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronary\\ndisease, the first indication of which can be sudden death.\\nCoronary artery disease occurs when the coronary\\narteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block-\\nage limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries,\\nwhich are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood\\nto the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heart\\nis working harder and needs more oxygen. Arteries\\nwould expand, for example, when a person is climbing\\nstairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unable\\nto expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial\\nischemia). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or\\npressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage\\ncuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction or heart muscle death).\\nHealthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and\\nslick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to let\\nmore blood through when the heart needs to work harder.\\nThe disease process in arteries is thought to begin with\\nan injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. This\\ninjury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis and\\nblood clots (thrombosis).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCoronary artery disease is usually caused by athero-\\nsclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu-\\nlate on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibrous\\ntissue, blood components, and calcium and harden into\\nartery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques often\\nform blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries\\n(coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and muscle\\nspasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi-\\ncates that infection from organisms such as chlamydia\\nbacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronary\\nartery disease.\\nA number of major contributing factors increase the\\nrisk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of these\\ncan be changed and some cannot. People with more risk\\nfactors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease.\\nMajor risk factors\\nMajor risk factors significantly increase the chance\\nof developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannot\\nbe changed are:\\n• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-\\ncans are also at increased risk because they experience\\na higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do.\\n• Sex—Men are more likely to have heart attacks than\\nwomen are and to have them at a younger age. Over age\\n60, however, women have coronary artery disease at a\\nrate equal to that of men.\\n• Age—Men who are 45 years of age and older and\\nwomen who are 55 years of age and older are more\\nlikely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally,\\ncoronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Older\\npeople (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heart\\nattack. Older women are twice as likely as older men to\\ndie within a few weeks of a heart attack.\\nMajor risk factors that can be changed are:\\n• Smoking—Smoking increases both the chance of\\ndeveloping coronary artery disease and the chance of\\ndying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like-\\nly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack.\\nThey are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to\\nhave a heart attack. They are also more likely to die\\nwithin an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smoke\\nmay also increase risk.\\n• High cholesterol—Dietary sources of cholesterol are\\nmeat, eggs, and other animal products. The body also\\nproduces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one’s\\nblood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is considered\\nhigh at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-\\n239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein\\n(LDL cholesterol) begin at 130–159 mg/dL, depending\\non other risk factors. Risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterol\\nlevels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person has\\nother risk factors, the risk multiplies.\\n• High blood pressure—High blood pressure makes the\\nheart work harder and weakens it over time. It increases\\nthe risk of heart attack,stroke, kidney failure, and con-\\ngestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over 90\\nor above is considered high. As the numbers rise, high\\nblood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4\\n(very severe).

Even modest physi-\\ncal activity, like walking, is beneficial if done regularly.\\n• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. More\\nthan 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart or\\nblood vessel disease.\\nContributing risk factors\\nContributing risk factors have been linked to coro-\\nnary artery disease, but their significance is not known\\nyet. Contributing risk factors are:\\n• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the\\nheart and increases the risk of developing coronary\\nartery disease even if no other risk factors are present.\\nObesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol\\nand can lead to diabetes.\\n• Stress and anger—Some scientists believe that stress\\nand anger can contribute to the development of coro-\\nnary artery disease and increase the blood’s tendency to\\nform clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physical\\nreaction to life’s irritations and challenges, increases\\nthe heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin-\\ning of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increases\\nthe risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heart\\nattack is more than double after an episode of anger.\\nChest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro-\\nnary heart disease but it is not always present. Other\\nsymptoms include shortness of breath, chest heaviness,\\ntightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres-\\nsure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, or\\njaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary artery\\ndisease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and\\n48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis-\\nease had no previous symptoms of the disease, according\\nto the American Heart Association.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who\\nwill take a medical history, discuss symptoms, listen to\\nthe heart, and perform basic screening tests. These tests\\nwill measure weight, blood pressure, blood lipid levels,\\nand fasting blood glucose levels. Other diagnostic tests\\ninclude resting and exercise electrocardiogram, echocar-\\ndiography, radionuclide scans, and coronary angiogra-\\nphy. The treadmill exercise (stress) test is an appropriate\\nscreening test for those with high risk factors even when\\nthey feel well.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s\\nactivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia).\\nElectrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on\\nthe patient’s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of\\nthe heart’s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to\\na recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about\\n10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. A\\ndefinite diagnosis cannot be made from electrocardiog-\\nraphy. About 50% of patients with significant coronary\\nartery disease have normal resting electrocardiograms.\\nAnother type of electrocardiogram, known as the exer-\\ncise stress test , measures how the heart and blood ves-\\nsels respond to exertion when the patient is exercising on\\na treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in\\na physician’s office or an exercise laboratory. It takes\\n15–30 minutes. It is not perfectly accurate. It sometimes\\ngives a normal reading when the patient has a heart prob-\\nlem or an abnormal reading when the patient does not.\\nIf the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is\\ninconclusive, the next step is exercise echocardiography\\nor nuclear scanning (angiography). Echocardiography,\\ncardiac ultrasound, uses sound waves to create an image\\nof the heart’s chambers and valves. A technician applies\\ngel to a hand-held transducer, then presses it against the\\npatient’s chest. The heart’s sound waves are converted\\ninto an image that can be displayed on a monitor. It does\\nnot reveal the coronary arteries themselves, but can\\ndetect abnormalities in heart wall motion caused by coro-\\nnary disease. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diag-\\nnostic laboratory, the test takes 30–60 minutes.\\nRadionuclide angiography enables physicians to see\\nthe blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans are\\nperformed by injecting a small amount of radiopharma-\\nceutical such as thallium into the bloodstream. A device\\nthat uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioac-\\ntive material (gamma camera) records pictures of the\\nheart. Radionuclide scans are not dangerous. The radia-\\ntion exposure is about the same as that in a chest x ray.\\nThe tiny amount of radioactive material used disappears\\nfrom the body in a few days. Radionuclide scans cost\\nabout four times as much as exercise stress tests but pro-\\nvide more information.\\nIn radionuclide angiography, a scanning camera\\npasses back and forth over the patient who lies on a table.\\nRadionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hos-\\npital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30–60\\nminutes. Thallium scanning is usually done in conjunc-\\ntion with an exercise stress test. When the stress test is\\nfinished, thallium or sestamibi is injected. The patient\\nresumes exercise for one minute to absorb the thallium.\\nFor patients who cannot exercise, cardiac blood flow and\\nheart rate may be increased by intravenous dipyridamole\\n(Persantine) or adenosine.

Coronary\\nangiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization\\nlaboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgery\\nunit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours.\\nTreatment\\nCoronary artery disease can be treated many ways.\\nThe choice of treatment depends on the severity of the\\ndisease. Treatments include lifestyle changes and drug\\ntherapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplas-\\nty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery\\ndisease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care.\\nAngioplasty or bypass surgery is not a “cure.”\\nPeople with less severe coronary artery disease may\\ngain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug\\ntherapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis-\\nease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weight\\nloss if needed, exercise, and not smoking—also help pre-\\nvent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changes\\nare discussed in more detail under prevention.\\nDrugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-\\nchannel blockers relieve chest pain and complications of\\ncoronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blocked\\narteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow to\\nthe heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reduce\\nthe amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress.\\nOne type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti-\\nazem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open and\\nreduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood\\nclots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood of\\na heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are also\\nindicated in most cases.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\\nbypass surgery are procedures that enter the body (inva-\\nsive procedures) to improve blood flow in the coronary\\narteries.

The procedure can be repeated.\\nIt is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery\\nbypass surgery.\\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or\\nvein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a\\ndetour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthy\\nvessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\\nBypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate for\\nthose patients with blockages in two or three major coro-\\nnary arteries, those with severely narrowed left main\\ncoronary arteries, and those who have not responded to\\nother treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen-\\neral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to support\\nthe patient while the healthy vein or artery is attached\\npast the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% of\\npatients who have bypass surgery experience full relief\\nfrom angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Only\\nabout 3–4% of patients per year experience a return of\\nsymptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decrease\\nover time.

In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is\\ninserted into the affected artery to burn or break down the\\nplaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per-\\nmanently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting is\\nbecoming more common.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNatural therapies may reduce the risk of certain\\ntypes of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con-\\nventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet\\n(including cold-water fish as a source of essential fatty\\nacids) and exercise, important components of conven-\\ntional prevention and treatment strategies, also are\\nemphasized in alternative approaches to coronary artery\\ndisease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies that\\nmay have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease.\\nFor example, ginger (Zingiber officinale ) may help\\nreduce cholesterol. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger, and\\nhot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers that\\ncan help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork,\\nmassage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies may\\nalso help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, or\\neven reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitamin\\nand mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect against\\ncoronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium and\\nmagnesium; B-complex vitamins; the anti-oxidant vita-\\nmins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese\\nmedicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage,\\nacupuncture, and dietary modification.\\nPrognosis\\nIn many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc-\\ncessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthier\\nlifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates\\nfrom coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. New\\ndiagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treat\\ncoronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech-\\nnologies and surgical procedures have extended the lives\\nof many patients who would otherwise have died.\\nResearch on coronary artery disease continues.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery\\ndisease and help keep it from progressing. A heart-\\nhealthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise,\\nmaintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderate\\ndrinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension,\\nand managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs\\nare excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problems\\nfor people who are at risk and who have had coronary\\nevents and procedures.\\nEat right\\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\\nlow in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol,\\nand high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta-\\nbles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but\\nhigh in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol but\\nhigh in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces-\\nsive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-forming\\nproteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated\\nfats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no more\\nthan 30% of total daily calories.\\nCholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is\\nfound in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal\\nproducts. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fiber\\ncan help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should be\\nlimited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popular\\nlipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by an\\naverage of 25–30% when used with a low-fat, low-cho-\\nlesterol diet.\\nFruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and\\nminerals. They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita-\\nmin C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg-\\netables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a form\\nthat damages coronary arteries.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n932\\nCoronary artery disease'),\n",

It recommends six to 11 servings of bread,\\ncereal, rice, and pasta; three to five servings of vegetables;\\ntwo to four servings of fruit; two to three servings of milk,\\nyogurt, and cheese; and two to three servings of meat,\\npoultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, and\\nsweets should be used sparingly. Canola and olive oil are\\nbetter for the heart than other cooking oils. Coronary\\npatients should be on a strict diet.\\nExercise regularly\\nAerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help con-\\ntrol weight, and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It may\\nkeep the blood vessels more flexible. The Centers for Dis-\\nease Control and Prevention and the American College of\\nSports Medicine recommend moderate to intense aerobic\\nexercise lasting about 30 minutes four or more times per\\nweek for maximum heart health. Three 10-minute exercise\\nperiods are also beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activities\\nsuch as walking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large mus-\\ncle groups and forces the body to use oxygen more effi-\\nciently. It can also include everyday activities such as active\\ngardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework. People with\\ncoronary artery disease or risk factors should consult a doc-\\ntor before beginning an exercise program.\\nMaintain a desirable body weight\\nAbout one quarter of all Americans are overweight\\nand nearly one-tenth are obese, according to the Surgeon\\nGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health. People who\\nare 20% or more over their ideal body weight have an\\nincreased risk of developing coronary artery disease.\\nLosing weight can help reduce total and LDL choles-\\nterol, reduce triglycerides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It\\nmay also reduce blood pressure. Eating right and exercis-\\ning are two key components of losing weight.\\nAvoid recreational drugs\\nDo not smoke or use tobacco. Smoking has many\\nadverse effects on the heart. It increases the heart rate,\\nconstricts major arteries, and can create irregular heart-\\nbeats. It raises blood pressure, contributes to the develop-\\nment of plaque, increases the formation of blood clots,\\nand causes blood platelets to cluster and impede blood\\nflow. Heart damage caused by smoking can be repaired\\nby quitting. Even heavy smokers can return to heart\\nhealth. Several studies have shown that ex-smokers face\\nthe same risk of heart disease as non-smokers within five\\nto 10 years after they quit.\\nDrink in moderation. Modest consumption of alco-\\nhol may actually protect against coronary artery disease\\nbecause alcohol appears to raise levels of HDL (“good”)\\ncholesterol. The American Heart Association defines\\nmoderate consumption as one ounce of alcohol per day,\\nroughly one cocktail, one 8-ounce glass of wine, or two\\n12-ounce glasses of beer. However, even moderate drink-\\ning can increase risk factors for heart disease for some\\npeople (by raising blood pressure, for example). Exces-\\nsive drinking is always bad for the heart. It usually raises\\nblood pressure and can poison the heart and cause abnor-\\nmal heart rhythms or even heart failure.\\nDo not use other recreational drugs. Commonly used\\nrecreational drugs, particularly cocaine and “crack,” can\\nseriously harm the heart and should never be used.\\nSeek treatment for hypertension\\nHigh blood pressure, one of the most common and\\nserious risk factors for coronary artery disease, can be\\ncompletely controlled through lifestyle changes and\\nmedication. Moderate hypertension can be controlled by\\nreducing dietary intake of sodium and fat, exercising reg-\\nularly, managing stress, abstaining from smoking, and\\ndrinking alcohol in moderation. People for whom these\\nchanges do not work or people with severe hypertension\\nmay be helped by many categories of medication.\\nManage stress\\nEveryone experiences stress, the mental and physi-\\ncal reaction to life’s irritations and challenges. Stress can\\nsometimes be avoided and when it is inevitable, it can be\\ncontrolled. Techniques for controlling stress include: tak-\\ning life more slowly, spending more time with family and\\nfriends, thinking positively, getting enough sleep, exer-\\ncising, and practicing relaxation techniques.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Heart Association and American Cancer Society.\\nLiving Well, Staying Well.New York: Time Books, 1996.\\nDeBakey Michael E., and Antonio M.

Balloon angioplasty is used in patients\\nwith coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood\\nvessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens,\\nthe oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. The\\nprimary cause of coronary artery disease is fat deposits\\nblocking the arteries (atherosclerosis ). In many cases,\\nballoon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closes\\nafter the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup-\\nport, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the need\\nfor coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain-\\nless steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed inside\\nan artery, the device comes in various sizes to match the\\nsize of the artery.\\nPrecautions\\nAny foreign object in the body, like a stent, will\\nincrease the risk of thrombosis. Anticlotting medication\\nis given to prevent this complication.\\nDescription\\nCoronary stenting usually follows balloon angio-\\nplasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter into\\nthe femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheter\\nis positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro-\\nnary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, and\\nis then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded into\\nthe artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal-\\nloon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronary\\nartery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent against\\nthe walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter is\\nremoved, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronary\\nartery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure\\nthat the stent is keeping the artery open.\\nAlternative procedures\\nBalloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per-\\nformed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease.\\nBy the time coronary artery disease progresses and\\nrequires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal-\\nloon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery.\\nCoronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However,\\nsince coronary artery disease can be related to high fat\\ndiets, smoking, and lack of exercise, changes in lifestyle\\nmay reduce the risk of developing the disease. Various\\nmedications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia-\\nbetes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease.\\nPreparation\\nBefore the stent is inserted, the patient will probably\\nbe instructed to take aspirin for several days.

The patient should remain flat and still for\\nawhile to allow the femoral artery to heal from the inser-\\ntion of the catheter. Medication to control blood clotting\\nshould be taken after the patient is discharged from the\\nhospital. A special diet may also be recommended that is\\nlow in vitamin K and cholesterol.

Jones, PhD\\nCoronary thrombosis see Heart attack\\nCoronavirus infection see Common cold\\nCorticosteroids\\nDefinition\\nCorticosteriods are a group of natural and synthetic\\nanalogues of the hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-\\nanterior pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, more com-\\nmonly referred to as the pituitary gland. These include\\nglucocorticoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents with\\na large number of other functions; mineralocorticoids,\\nwhich control salt and water balance primarily through\\naction on the kidneys; and corticotropins, which control\\nsecretion of hormones by the pituitary gland.\\nPurpose\\nGlucocorticoids have multiple effects, and are used\\nfor a large number of conditions. They affect glucose uti-\\nlization, fat metabolism, and bone development, and are\\npotent anti-inflammatory agents. They may be used for\\nreplacement of natural hormones in patients with pitu-\\nitary deficiency (Addison’s disease ), as well as for a\\nwide number of other conditions including, but not limit-\\ned to, arthritis,asthma, anemia, various cancers, and\\nskin inflammations. Additional uses include inhibition of\\nnausea and vomitingafter chemotherapy, treatment of\\nseptic shock, treatment of spinal cord injuries, and treat-\\nment of hirisutism (excessive hair growth). The choice of\\ndrug will vary with the condition. Cortisone and hydro-\\ncortisone, which have both glucocorticoid and mineralo-\\ncorticoid effects, are the drugs of choice for replacement\\ntherapy of natural hormone deficiency. Synthetic com-\\npounds, which have greater anti-inflammatory effects\\nand less effect on salt and water balance, are usually pre-\\nferred for other purposes. These compounds include dex-\\namethasone, which is almost exclusively glucocorticoid\\nin its actions, as well as prednisone, prednisolone,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 935\\nCorticosteroids'),\n",

Glucocorti-\\ncoids are formulated in oral dosage forms, topical creams\\nand ointments, oral and nasal inhalations, rectal foams,\\nand ear and eye drops.\\nMineralocorticoids control the retention of sodium\\nin the kidneys. In mineralocorticoid deficiency, there is\\nexcessive loss of sodium through the kidneys, with\\nresulting water loss. Fludrocortisone (Florinef) is the\\nonly drug available for treatment of mineralocorticoid\\ndeficiency, and is available only in an oral dosage form.\\nCorticotropin (ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone)\\nstimulates the pituitary gland to release cortisone. A defi-\\nciency of corticotropic hormone will have the same effects\\nas a deficiency of cortisone.

Halluci-\\nnations usually result from drugs or mental disor-\\nders.\\nHormone—A substance that is produced in one\\npart of the body, then travels through the blood-\\nstream to another part of the body where it has its\\neffect.\\nInflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\\nthat usually develop in response to injury or ill-\\nness.\\nOintment—A thick, spreadable substance that\\ncontains medicine and is meant to be used on the\\noutside of the body.\\nPregnancy category—A system of classifying\\ndrugs according to their established risks for use\\nduring pregnancy. Category A: controlled human\\nstudies have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category\\nB: animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no\\nhuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, but\\nnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:\\nno adequate human or animal studies; or adverse\\nfetal effects in animal studies, but no available\\nhuman data. Category D: evidence of fetal risk,\\nbut benefits outweigh risks. Category X: evidence\\nof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosage of glucocorticoids varies with the drug,\\nroute of administration, condition being treated, and\\npatient. Consult specific references.\\nFludrocortisone, for use in replacement therapy, is\\nnormally dosed at 0.1 mg/day. Some patients require\\nhigher doses. It should normally be administered in con-\\njunction with cortisone or hydrocortisone.\\nACTH, when used for diagnostic purposes, is given\\nas 10–25 units dissolved in 500 ml of 5% dextrose injec-\\ntion-infused IV over eight hours. A long-acting form,\\nwhich may be used for replacement therapy, is given by\\nsubcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection at a\\ndose of 40 to 80 units every 24–72 hours.\\nPrecautions\\nGlucocorticoids\\nThe most significant risk associated with administra-\\ntion of glucocorticoids is suppression of natural corticos-\\nteroid secretion. When the hormones are administered,\\nthey suppress the secretion of ACTH, which in turn\\nreduces the secretion of the natural hormones. The extent\\nof suppression varies with dose, drug potency, duration of\\ntreatment, and individual patient response. While suppres-\\nsion is seen primarily with drugs administered systemical-\\nly, it can also occur with topical drugs such as creams and\\nointments, or drugs administered by inhalation. Abrupt\\ncessation of corticosteroids may result in acute adrenal cri-\\nsis (Addisonian crisis) that is marked by dehydration\\nwith severe vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, and loss\\nof consciousness. Acute adrenal crisis is potentially fatal.\\nChronic overdose of glucocorticoids leads to Cushin-\\ngoid syndrome, which is clinically identical to Cushing’s\\nsyndrome and differs only in that in Cushingoid, the\\nexcessive steroids are from drug therapy rather than\\nexcessive glandular secretion. Symptoms vary, but most\\npeople have upper body obesity, rounded face, increased\\nfat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. In its\\nlater stages, this condition leads to weakening of bones\\nand muscles with rib and spinal column fractures.\\nThe short term adverse effects of corticosteroids are\\ngenerally mild, and include indigestion , increased\\nappetite, insomnia , and nervousness.

It entails the use of a bleaching solution\\napplied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over the\\nteeth used at home under a dentist’s supervision. Bond-\\ning involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, called\\ncomposite resin, to the surface of chipped or broken\\nteeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth\\n(giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gaps\\nbetween teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells that\\ncover the front of the teeth. They can improve the\\nappearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis-\\naligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam-\\nel from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth.\\nOrthodontics uses braces to correct the position of\\ncrowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificial\\nteeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replace\\nmissing teeth.\\nPreparation\\nBleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching\\ntray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home for\\nseveral hours each day or night. Teeth slowly become\\nwhite over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching can\\nalso be done in a dentist’s office. A heat- or light-activated\\nbleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit.\\nBonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so\\ncomposite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours the\\nresin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes the\\nresin after it is hard and dry.\\nTo prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer\\nof enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finished\\ntooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres-\\nsion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will be\\ncreated. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etched\\nwith an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted on\\nthe tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardened\\nwith a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBleaching —Technique used to brighten stained\\nteeth.\\nBonding—Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering\\ntooth defects using tooth-colored materials.\\nComposite resin—Plastic material matching natur-\\nal tooth color used to replace missing parts of a\\ntooth.\\nDuring cosmetic reshaping, some enamel is\\nremoved from the uneven tooth so it more closely match-\\nes other teeth.\\nOrthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth,\\nand wires are threaded through the braces. These wires\\nare adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desired\\nnew positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teeth\\nare straightened.\\nImplants are more secure and natural looking than\\ndentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive.\\nFirst an anchor for the implant is attached to the jaw\\nbone. This surgery can take several hours. About six\\nmonths later, after the bone around the anchor has\\nhealed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificial\\ntooth is attached to the post. The whole process may take\\nabout nine months to complete.\\nAftercare\\nPeriodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth\\nwhite if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, the\\nresin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcorn\\nkernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teeth\\nmay need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Once\\northodontic braces are removed, regular visits to the\\northodontist are advised because teeth can shift position.\\nImplanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensure\\nthat the anchor and post are stable.\\nRisks\\nAfter teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if\\nexposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco.\\nSome patients experience increased sensitivity to cold\\nwhile teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usually\\ndisappears shortly after completion of the treatment.\\nBonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain\\nmore easily than natural teeth.

Some patients fear they are having a\\nheart attack. The most severe pain is usually between the\\nbreast and the upper abdomen. The pain may be greater\\nwhen in sitting or reclining positions. Stress may aggra-\\nvate this condition. Generally the third or fourth ribs are\\naffected. However, any of the seven costochondral junc-\\ntions may be affected, and more often than not more than\\none site is involved. The inflammation can involve carti-\\nlage areas on both sides of the sternum, but usually is on\\none side only. Costochondritis should be distinguished\\nfrom Tietze Syndrome, which is an inflammation involv-\\ning the same area of the chest, but also includes swelling.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of costochondritis are not well-under-\\nstood and may be difficult to establish. The most likely\\ncauses include injury, repetitive minor trauma, and\\nunusual excessive physical activity.\\nThe primary symptom of costochondritis is severe\\nchest wall pain, which may vary in intensity. The pain\\nbecomes worse with trunk movement, deep breathing,\\nand/or exertion, and better with decreased movement, quiet\\nbreathing, or changing of position. It is usually localized but\\nmay radiate extensively from the chest area. The pain has\\nbeen described as sharp, nagging, aching, or pressure-like.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is based on pain upon palpation (gentle\\npressing) of the affected joints. Swelling is not associated\\nwith costochondritis. Diagnosis is also dependent on the\\nexclusion of other causes, including heart attack or bac-\\nterial or fungal infections found in IV drug users or post-\\noperative thoracic surgery patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and\\nto control pain. To accomplish these goals, nonsteroidal\\nanti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used, with ibupro-\\nfen usually selected as the drug of choice. Other NSAIDS\\noptions are flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and\\nnaproxen. Additional treatment recommendations include\\nthe use of local heat,biofeedback, and gentle stretching of\\nthe pectoralis muscles two to three times a day.\\nFor more difficult cases, where the patient continues\\nto exhibit pain and discomfort, cortisone injections are\\nused as therapy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSupplements that are used to reduce inflammation\\nhave been used to treat costochondritis. Examples of\\nsuch supplements include ginger root, evening primrose\\noil, bromelain, vitamin E, omega-3 oils, and white wil-\\nlow bark. Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, which may\\naid in the healing of cartilage, has also been used.

Coughing protects the respiratory sys-\\ntem by clearing it of irritants and secretions.\\nDescription\\nWhile people can generally cough voluntarily, a\\ncough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stim-\\nulates one or more of the cough receptors found at dif-\\nferent points in the respiratory system. These receptors\\nthen send a message to the cough center in the brain,\\nwhich in turn tells the body to cough. A cough begins\\nwith a deep breath in, at which point the opening\\nbetween the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx\\n(glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs. As the\\ndiaphragm and other muscles involved in breathing\\npress against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, pro-\\nducing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than\\n100 mi (160 km) per hour.\\nIn normal situations, most people cough once or\\ntwice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-\\ntants. However, when the level of irritants in the air is\\nhigh or when the respiratory system becomes infected,\\ncoughing may become frequent and prolonged. It may\\ninterfere with exercise or sleep, and it may also cause dis-\\ntress if accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or breath-\\nlessness. In the majority cases, frequent coughing lasts\\none to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infection\\nsubsides. If a cough lasts more than three weeks it is con-\\nsidered a chronic cough, and physicians will try to deter-\\nmine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant.\\nCoughs are generally described as either dry or pro-\\nductive. A dry cough does not bring up a mixture of\\nmucus, irritants, and other substances from the lungs\\n(sputum), while a productive cough does. In the case of a\\nbacterial infection, the sputum brought up in a productive\\ncough may be greenish, gray, or brown. In the case of an\\nallergy or viral infection it may be clear or white. In the\\nmost serious conditions, the sputum may contain blood.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn the majority of cases, coughs are caused by respi-\\nratory infections, including:\\n• colds or influenza, the most common causes of coughs\\n• bronchitis, an inflammation of the mucous membranes\\nof the bronchial tubes\\n• croup, a viral inflammation of the larynx, windpipe,\\nand bronchial passages that produces a bark-like cough\\nin children\\n• whooping cough, a bacterial infection accompanied by\\nthe high-pitched cough for which it is named\\n• pneumonia , a potentially serious bacterial infection\\nthat produces discolored or bloody mucus\\n• tuberculosis , another serious bacterial infection that\\nproduces bloody sputum\\n• fungal infections, such as aspergillosis , histoplasmo-\\nsis, and cryptococcoses\\nEnvironmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke,\\ndust, or smog, can also cause a cough. In the case of cig-\\narette smokers, the nicotine present in the smoke para-\\nlyzes the hairs (cilia) that regularly flush mucus from the\\nrespiratory system. The mucus then builds up, forcing\\nthe body to removed it by coughing. Post-nasal drip, the\\nirritating trickle of mucus from the nasal passages into\\nthe throat caused by allergies or sinusitis, can also result\\nin a cough. Some chronic conditions, such as asthma,\\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis, are\\ncharacterized in part by a cough.

A cough can also be a side-effect\\nof medications that are administered via an inhaler. It can\\nalso be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors,\\nwhich are drugs used for treating high blood pressure.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo determine the cause of a cough, a physician\\nshould take an exact medical history and perform an\\nexam. Information regarding the duration of the cough,\\nwhat other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi-\\nronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or\\nher diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also\\nhelp determine what type of infection, if any, may be\\ninvolved. The doctor may even observe the sputum\\nmicroscopically for the presence of bacteria and white\\nblood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence\\nand extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo-\\nsis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause\\nof the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be\\nordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to\\ninspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of a cough generally involves addressing\\nthe condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu-\\nmonia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced\\ncough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators,\\nor an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an\\nallergy.

The\\ntwo types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives\\nand expectorants.\\nAntitussives\\nAntitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar-\\ncotics—primarily codeine—are used as antitussives and\\nwork by depressing the cough center in the brain. How-\\never, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau-\\nsea, and constipation .

Demulcents\\nrelieve coughing by coating irritated passageways.\\nExpectorants\\nExpectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to\\ncough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate\\nare the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter\\nexpectorants. However, some studies have shown that in\\nacute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the\\nsame thinning effect as taking expectorants.\\nAlternative treatment\\nCoughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory\\ninfections may be effectively treated with botanical and\\nhomeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary\\nand be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some\\ncombination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic\\ncough formulas can be very effective for cough relief.\\nLingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated\\nby a trained practitioner.\\nMany health practitioners advise increasing fluids\\nand breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen-\\ning chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored\\nwith honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs\\ncaused by colds or flu.

Avoiding of\\nmucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a\\ncough condition. These mucous-producing foods can\\nvary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products\\nare a major mucous-producing food for most people.\\nPrognosis\\nBecause the majority of coughs are related to the\\ncommon cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21\\ndays.

The graduates of these two disciplines have\\nrefined and enhanced these original approaches and\\nrenamed their work as sacro-occipital technique, cranial\\nmovement therapy, or craniosacral therapy.\\nDr. John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, and\\nothers at the Department of Biomechanics at Michigan\\nState University, College of Osteopathic Medicine\\nlearned of Sutherland’s research and developed it further.\\nHe researched the clinical observations of various osteo-\\npathic physicians. This research provided the basis for\\nUpledger’s work that he named craniosacral therapy.\\nCraniosacral therapy addresses the craniosacral sys-\\ntem. This system includes the cranium, spine, and\\nsacrum that are connected by a continuous membrane of\\nconnective tissue deep inside the body, called the dura\\nmater. The dura mater also encloses the brain and the\\ncentral nervous system. Sutherland noticed that cerebral\\nspinal fluid rises and falls within the compartment of the\\ndura mata. He called this movement the primary respira-\\ntory impulse; today it is known as the craniosacral\\nrhythm (CSR) or the cranial wave.\\nCraniosacral therapists can most easily feel the CSR\\nin the body by lightly touching the base of the skull or\\nthe sacrum. During a session, they feel for disturbances\\nin the rate, amplitude, symmetry, and quality of flow of\\nthe CSR. A therapist uses very gentle touch to balance\\nthe flow of the CSR. Once the cerebrospinal fluid moves\\nfreely, the body’s natural healing responses can function.\\nA craniosacral session generally lasts 30–90 min-\\nutes. The client remains fully clothed and lays down on a\\nmassage table while the therapist gently assesses the\\nflow of the CSR. Upledger describes several techniques\\nwhich may be used in a craniosacral therapy session. The\\nfirst is energy cyst release. “This technique is a hands-on\\nmethod of releasing foreign or disruptive energies from\\nthe patient’s body. Energy cysts may cause the disruption\\nof the tissues and organs were they are located.” The\\ntherapist feels these cysts in the client’s body and gently\\nreleases the blockage of energy.\\nSutherland first wrote about a second practice called\\ndirection of energy. In this technique the therapist intends\\nenergy to pass from one of his hands, through the patient,\\ninto the other hand.\\nWILLIAM SUTHERLAND\\n(1873–1954)\\nWilliam Garner Sutherland studied osteopathy\\nunder its founder, Andrew Taylor Still. Dr. Sutherland\\nmade his own important discovery while examining the\\nsutures of cranial bones the skull bones that protect the\\nbrain. What he noticed is that the sutures were designed\\nfor motion. Sutherland termed this motion the Breath of\\nLife. Through his experiments and research he deter-\\nmined that primary respiration was essential to all other\\nphysiological functions.\\nWhen Sutherland developed his techniques for\\ncraniosacral therapy, he wanted it to serve as a vehicle\\nfor listening to the body’s rhythmic motions and treat the\\npatterns of inertia when those motions become congest-\\ned. He believed that the stresses—any physical or emo-\\ntional trauma—created an imbalance in the body that\\nneeded correction to restore it to full health. The therapy\\nis a hands-on method so that the therapist can feel the\\nsubtleties of the patterns of movement and inertia.\\nSutherland felt that this was the way to encourage self-\\nhealing and restoration of the body’s own mechanisms,\\ntaking a holistic approach to creating optimal health.\\nThe Craniosacral Therapy Educational Trust, based\\non Sutherland’s pioneering work, is located at 10 Norm-\\nington Close, Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2QS,\\nUnited Kingdom. The phone number is 07000 785778.\\nThe third technique is called myofascial release.\\nThis is a manipulative form of bodywork that releases\\ntension in the fascia or connective tissue of the body.\\nThis form of bodywork uses stronger touch.\\nUpledger’s fourth technique is position of release.\\nThis involves following the client’s body into the posi-\\ntions in which an injury occurred and holding it there.\\nWhen the rhythm of the CSR suddenly stops the therapist\\nknows that the trauma has been released.\\nThe last technique is somatoemotional release. This\\ntechnique was developed by Upledger and is an offshoot\\nof craniosacral therapy. It is used to release the mind and\\nbody of the residual effects of trauma and injury that are\\n“locked in the tissues.”\\nThe cost of a session varies due to the length of time\\nneeded and the qualifications of the therapist. The cost\\nmay be covered by insurance when the therapy is per-\\nformed or prescribed by a licensed health care provider.\\nPrecautions\\nThis gentle approach is extremely safe in most cases.\\nHowever, craniosacral therapy is not recommended in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n945\\nCraniosacral therapy'),\n",

Normally, very lit-\\ntle CK is found circulating in the blood. Elevated levels\\nindicate damage to either muscle or brain; possibly from\\na myocardial infarction (heart attack ), muscle disease,\\nor stroke.\\nThere are three types, or isoforms, of CK:\\n• CK-I, or BB, is produced primarily by brain and\\nsmooth muscle.\\n• CK-II, or MB, is produced primarily by heart muscle.\\n• CK-III, or MM, is produced primarily by skeletal muscle.\\nPrecautions\\nNo special precautions are necessary, except in\\npatients with a bleeding disorder.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCraniotome—A type of surgical drill used to oper-\\nate on the skull. It has a self-controlled system that\\nstops the drill when the bone is penetrated.\\nDescription\\nA small amount of blood is drawn and used for labo-\\nratory analysis.\\nPreparation\\nPhysical activity may cause a rise in CK levels,\\nespecially the CK-III fraction. Therefore, patients should\\nnot engage in strenuous physical activity the day of the\\ntest. The patient should report any recent injections, falls,\\nor bruises that have occurred, as these may elevate CK\\nlevels as well.\\nAftercare\\nNo aftercare is required, except to keep the puncture\\nsite clean while it heals.\\nRisks\\nThere are no risks to this test beyond the very slight\\nrisk of infection at the puncture site.\\nNormal results\\nIn females, total CK should be 10–79 units per liter\\n(U/L). In males, total CK should be 17–148 U/L. CK lev-\\nels are reduced in the first half of pregnancy , and\\nincreased in the second half. CK levels are elevated in\\nnewborns.\\nThe distribution of isoenzymes should be:\\n• CK-I: 0%\\n• CK-II: 0–5%\\n• CK-III: 95–100%\\nAbnormal results\\nElevation of CK-I may be seen in stroke, extreme\\nshock, or brain tumor.\\nElevation of CK-II is seen after a myocardial infarc-\\ntion. It begins to rise three to six hours after the heart\\nattack, and may peak within 24 hours. It should then\\nreturn to normal. For this reason, it is a useful marker for\\nrecent myocardial infarction, but not for one which\\noccurred more than a day before the test.\\nElevation of CK-III indicates skeletal muscle dam-\\nage. This may occur from normal exercise , trauma, or\\nmuscle disease. CK levels may be very high early on in\\nmuscular dystrophy, but may fall to normal later as\\nmuscle tissue is lost. Elevated CK is also seen in myosi-\\ntis, myoglobinuria,toxoplasmosis , and trichinosis .\\nHypothyroidism may also cause elevated CK.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n948\\nCreatine kinase test'),\n",

When the\\nkidneys are functioning normally, the serum creatinine\\nlevel should remain constant and normal. Slight increas-\\nes in creatine levels can appear after meals, especially\\nafter ingestion of large quantities of meat, and some diur-\\nnal variation may occur, with a low point at 7 A.M. and a\\npeak at 7 P.M. Serious renal disorders, such as glomeru-\\nlonephritis , pyelonephritis , and urinary obstruction,\\nwill cause abnormal elevations.\\nThe creatinine level is interpreted in conjunction\\nwith another kidney function test called the Blood Urea\\nNitrogen (BUN). The serum creatinine level has much\\nthe same significance as the BUN but tends to rise later.\\nBecause of this, determinations of creatinine help to\\nchronicle a disease process. Generally, a doubling of cre-\\natinine suggests a 50% reduction in kidney filtration rate.\\nPreparation\\nThe creatinine test requires a blood sample. It is rec-\\nommended that the patient be fasting (nothing to eat or\\ndrink) for at least eight hours before the test. The physi-\\ncian may also require that ascorbic acid (vitamin C),\\nbarbiturates, and diuretics be withheld for 24 hours.\\nRisks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma\\n(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nNormal values can vary from laboratory to laborato-\\nry, but are generally in the following ranges:\\n• Adult female: 0.5–1.1 mg/dL\\n• Adult male: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL\\n• Adolescent: 0.5–1.0 mg/dL\\n• Child: 0.3–0.7 mg/dL\\n• Infant: 0.2–0.4 mg/dL\\n• Newborn: 0.3–1.2 mg/dL\\nNote that variations between sources for serum crea-\\ntinine normal ranges are greater than for other important\\ntests.

In its most serious form, complications\\ncan include high blood pressure (hypertension)\\nand renal failure.\\ncalled a spongioform degeneration that seems to be relat-\\ned to “mad cow disease.”\\nDescription\\nBefore 1995, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was little-\\nknown outside of the medical profession; even within it,\\nmany practitioners did not know much about it. Most\\ndoctors had never seen a case. With the recognition of a\\nso-called “new variant” or simply variant form of CJD\\nwith the strong possibility that those with it became\\ninfected simply by eating contaminated beef, CJD has\\nbecome one of the most talked-about diseases in the\\nworld. Additionally, the radical theory that the infectious\\nagent is a normal protein that has been changed in its\\nform has also sparked much interest.\\nFirst described in the first part of the twentieth cen-\\ntury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is a\\nneurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressing\\ndementiaending in death, usually within eight months\\nof the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease,\\naffecting only about one in every million in the popula-\\ntion through out the world. In the United States, CJD is\\nthought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affects\\nadults primarily between ages 50 and 75.\\nSpongiform encephalopathies\\nThe most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the\\nformation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain\\n(vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD is\\none of several human “spongiform encephalopathies,”\\ndiseases that produce this characteristic change in brain\\ntissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker\\ndisease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere-\\nbellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatal\\nfamilial insomnia, associated with progressive insomnia,\\nautonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused by\\nmotor system dysfunction.\\nKuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua,\\nNew Guinea, and spread from infected individuals after\\ntheir deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, in\\nwhich the relatives of the dead person honored him by\\nconsuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery of\\nthe infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize for\\nCarleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period for\\nkuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuru\\nhas virtually disappeared following the cessation of these\\ncannibalistic practices, several new cases continue to\\narise each year.\\nCases of CJD have been grouped into three types:\\nfamilial, iatrogenic, and sporadic.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n950\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease'),\n",

The rise in organ dona-\\ntion has increased this route of transmission; grafts of\\ninfected corneas and dura mater (the tissue covering the\\nbrain) have been shown to transmit CJD. Another\\nsource is hormones concentrated from the pituitary\\nglands of cadavers, some of whom carried CJD, for use\\nin people with growth hormone deficiencies. Iatrogenic\\ninfection from exposure to nerve-containing tissue rep-\\nresents a small fraction of all cases. The incubation\\nperiod between exposure to the infectious agent is very\\nlong and is estimated to be from less than 10 to more\\nthan 30 years. It remains unlikely, but not impossible,\\nthat blood from patients with CJD is infectious to oth-\\ners by transfusion.\\n• Sporadic CJD represents at least 85% of all cases. Spo-\\nradic cases have no identifiable source of infection. Death\\nusually follows first symptoms within eight months.\\nAnimal forms and “mad cow disease”\\nSix forms of spongiform encephalopathies are\\nknown to occur in other mammals: scrapie in sheep, rec-\\nognized for more than 200 years; chronic wasting disease\\nin elk and mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado; trans-\\nmissible mink encephalopathy; exotic ungulate\\nencephalopathy in some types of zoo animals; feline\\nspongiform encephalopathy in domestic cats; and bovine\\nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows.\\nBSE was first recognized in Britain in 1986. Besides\\nthe spongiform changes in the brain, BSE causes demen-\\ntia-like behavioral changes—hence the name “mad cow\\ndisease.” BSE was thought to be an altered form of\\nscrapie, transmitted to cows when they were fed sheep\\noffal (slaughterhouse waste) as part of their feed, but it is\\nnow thought to be more likely to be a primary cattle dis-\\nease spread by contaminated feed.\\nThe use of slaughterhouse offal in animal feed has\\nbeen common in many countries and has been practiced\\nfor at least 50 years. The trigger for the BSE epidemic in\\nGreat Britain seems to have come in the early 1980s,\\nwhen the use of organic solvents for preparation of offal\\nwas altered there. It is possible that these solvents had\\nbeen destroying the agent called a prion, thereby prevent-\\ning infection, and that the change in preparation proce-\\ndure opened the way for the agent to “jump species” and\\ncause BSE in cows that consumed scrapie-infected meal.\\nThe slaughter of infected (but not yet visibly sick) cows\\nat the end of their useful farm lives, and the use of their\\ncarcasses for feed, spread the infection rapidly and wide-\\nly. For at least a year after BSE was first recognized in\\nBritish herds, infected bovine remains continued to be\\nincorporated into feed, spreading the disease still further.\\nAlthough milk from infected cows has never been shown\\nto pass the infectious agent, passage from infected moth-\\ner to calf may have occurred through unknown means.\\nBeginning in 1988, the British government took\\nsteps to stop the spread of BSE, banning the use of\\nbovine offal in feed and other products and ordering the\\nslaughter of infected cows. By then, the slow-acting\\nagent had become epidemic in British herds. In 1992, it\\nwas diagnosed in over 25,000 animals (1% of the\\nBritish herd). By mid-1997, the cumulative number of\\nBSE cases in the United Kingdom had risen to more\\nthan 170,000. The feeding ban did stem the tide of the\\nepidemic; however, the number of new cases each week\\nfell from a peak of 1,000 in 1993 to less than 300 two\\nyears later.\\nThe export of British feed and beef to member coun-\\ntries was banned by the European Union, but cases of\\nBSE had developed in Europe by then as well; however,\\nby mid-1997, only about 1,000 cases had been identified.\\nIn 1989, the United States banned import of British beef\\nand began monitoring United States herds in 1990.

Epidemiological\\nmodels of infectious disease produce estimates ranging\\nfrom less than one hundred (a level already broken) to\\ntens of thousands or more, depending on the assumptions\\nused by the modelers. The incubation period of vCJD in\\nhumans is not known, nor are the genetic and environ-\\nmental risk factors that influence susceptibility, nor the\\nquantity of infectious agent needed to cause the disease.\\nIt is estimated that between one and two million infected\\ncattle have been eaten by humans, most in the earliest\\nstages of the epidemic. Estimates cannot be based on the\\nvery few cases that have developed so far. These cases\\ncould represent the very few people with the right combi-\\nnation of exposure and susceptibility to a relatively fast-\\ndeveloping infection, or they could be the first few vic-\\ntims of a slower-acting, more highly infectious agent.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nIt is clear that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by\\nan infectious agent, but it is not yet clear what type of\\nagent that is. Originally assumed to be a virus, evidence\\nis accumulating that, instead, CJD is caused by a protein\\ncalled a prion (PREE-on, for “proteinaceous infectious\\nparticle”) transmitted from victim to victim. The other\\nspongiform encephalopathies are also hypothesized to be\\ndue to prion infection.\\nIf this hypothesis is proved true, it would represent\\none of the most radical new ideas in biology since the\\ndiscovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All infec-\\ntious diseases, in fact all life, uses nucleic acids—DNA\\nor ribonucleic acid (RNA)—to code the instructions\\nneeded for reproduction. Inactivation of the nucleic acids\\ndestroys the capacity to reproduce. However, when these\\nsame measures are applied to infected tissue from\\nspongiform encephalopathy victims, infectivity is not\\ndestroyed. Furthermore, purification of infected tissue to\\nconcentrate the infectious fraction yields protein, not\\nnucleic acid. While it remains possible that some highly\\nstable nucleic acid remains hidden within the purified\\nprotein, this is seemingly less and less likely as further\\nexperiments are done. The “prion hypothesis,” as it is\\ncalled, is now widely accepted, at least provisionally, by\\nmost researchers in the field. The most vocal proponent\\nof the hypothesis, Stanley Prusiner, was awarded the\\nNobel Prize in 1997 for his work in the prion diseases.\\nA prion is an altered form of a normal brain protein.\\nThe normal protein has a helical shape along part of its\\nlength. In the prion form, a sheet structure replaces the\\nhelix. According to the hypothesis, when the normal\\nform interacts with the prion form, some of its helical\\npart is converted to a sheet, thus creating a new prion\\ncapable of transforming other normal forms. In this way,\\nthe disease process resembles crystallization more than\\ntypical viral infection, in which the virus commands the\\nhost’s cellular machinery to reproduce more of the virus.\\nBuild-up of the sheet form causes accumulation of\\nabnormal protein clumps and degeneration of brain cells,\\nwhich is thought to cause the disease.\\nThe brain protein affected by the prion, called PrP, is\\npart of the membrane of brain cells, but its exact function\\nis unknown. It is composed of about 250 subunits, called\\namino acids, coded for by a gene on chromosome 20.\\nSlight genetic differences, called polymorphisms, give\\nrise to two slightly different normal protein forms: sub-\\nunit 129 is a “methionine” in one form, but is “valine” in\\nthe other. A person may have all of one, all of the other,\\nor a mixture of the two, depending on their genetic inher-\\nitance. Both forms have the normal helical structure, and\\nfunction normally. However, susceptibility to prion con-\\nversion is influenced by subunit 129: a person with a\\nmixture of forms is more resistant to conversion. All the\\ncases of vCJD tested have had just methionine at 129.\\nExposure to the infectious agent is, of course, still\\nrequired for disease development. Prion diseases are not\\ncontagious in the usual sense, and transmission from an\\ninfected person to another person requires direct inocula-\\ntion of infectious material.\\nFamilial CJD, on the other hand, does not require\\nexposure, but develops through the inheritance of other,\\nmore disruptive mutations in the gene for the normal PrP\\nprotein. Researchers believe these mutations increase the\\nlikelihood that the protein may more spontaneously\\n“flip” to the sheet form; once created, these can then con-\\nvert other normal-form molecules.

Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\\nscans (CT) should be done to exclude other forms of\\ndementia, and in CJD typically shows atrophy or loss of\\nbrain tissue. Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may be\\ndone to rule out other causes of dementia (as cell count,\\nchemical analysis, and other routine tests are normal in\\nCJD) and to identify elevated levels of marker proteins\\nknown as 14-3-3.

However, the rapid\\nprogression of CJD frustrates most attempts at treatment,\\nsince decreasing cognitive function and more prominent\\nbehavioral symptoms develop so quickly.

Individuals with this syndrome have\\nunusual facial features, poor muscle tone(hypotonia),\\nsmall head size (microcephaly), and mental\\nretardation. A classic feature of the syndrome is the cat-\\nlike cry made by infants with this disorder.\\nDescription\\nDr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn-\\ndrome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-like\\ncry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du\\nchat means “cry of the cat” in French. This unusual cry is\\ncaused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ in\\nthe throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chat\\nsyndrome is also called “5p minus syndrome” because it\\nis caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic material\\nfrom chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chat\\nsyndrome occurs on the short or “p” arm of chromosome\\n5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel-\\nopment. Absence of this material results in the features\\nassociated with cri du chat syndrome.\\nA high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic\\nfeature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typically\\nhave low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro-\\ncephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cri\\ndu chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals with\\ncri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayed\\nmotor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav-\\nioral problems may also develop as the child matures.\\nIt has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome\\noccurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According to\\nthe 5p minus Society, approximately 50–60 children are\\nborn with cri du chat syndrome in the United States each\\nyear. It can occur in all races and in both sexes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCri du chat is the result of a chromosome abnormali-\\nty—a deleted piece of chromosomal material on chromo-\\nsome 5. In 90% of patients with cri du chat syndrome,\\nthe deletion is sporadic. This means that it happens ran-\\ndomly and is not hereditary. If a child has cri du chat due\\nto a sporadic deletion, the chance the parents could have\\nanother child with cri du chat is 1%. In approximately\\n10% of patients with cri du chat, there is a hereditary\\nchromosomal rearrangement that causes the deletion. If a\\nparent has this rearrangement, the risk for them to have a\\nchild with cri du chat is greater than 1%.\\nAn abnormal larynx causes the unusual cat-like cry\\nmade by infants that is a hallmark feature of the syndrome.\\nAs children with cri du chat get older, the cat-like cry\\nbecomes less noticeable. This can make the diagnosis\\nmore difficult in older patients. In addition to the cat-like\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n954\\nCri du chat syndrome'),\n",

Inflammation refers\\nto swelling, redness, and loss of normal function. There\\nis evidence that the inflammation is caused by various\\nproducts of the immune system that attack the body itself\\ninstead of helpfully attacking a foreign invader (a virus\\nor bacteria, for example). The inflammation of Crohn’s\\ndisease most commonly affects the last part of the ileum\\n(a section of the small intestine), and often includes the\\nlarge intestine (the colon). However, inflammation may\\nalso occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract,\\naffecting the mouth, esophagus, or stomach. Crohn’s dis-\\nease differs from ulcerative colitis, the other major type\\nof IBD, in two important ways:\\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease may be discontin-\\nuous, meaning that areas of involvement in the intestine\\nmay be separated by normal, unaffected segments of\\nintestine. The affected areas are called “regional enteri-\\ntis,” while the normal areas are called “skip areas.”\\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease affects all the lay-\\ners of the intestinal wall, while ulcerative colitis affects\\nonly the lining of the intestine.\\nAlso, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the\\nsmall intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminal\\nileum (so-called “backwash” ileitis).\\nIn addition to inflammation, Crohn’s disease causes\\nulcerations, or irritated pits in the intestinal wall. These\\npits occur because the inflammation has made areas of\\ntissue shed.\\nCrohn’s disease may be diagnosed at any age,\\nalthough most diagnoses are made between the ages of\\n15–35. About 0.02–0.04% of the population suffers from\\nthis disorder, with men and women having an equal\\nchance of being stricken. Whites are more frequently\\naffected than other racial groups, and people of Jewish ori-\\ngin are between three and six times more likely to suffer\\nfrom IBD. IBD runs in families; an IBD patient has a 20%\\nchance of having other relatives who are fellow sufferers.\\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic disorder. While the\\nsymptoms can be improved, a patient will not be com-\\npletely cured of the underlying disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown. No infec-\\ntious agent (virus, bacteria, or fungi) has been identified\\nas the cause of Crohn’s disease. Still, some researchers\\nhave theorized that some type of infection may have\\noriginally been responsible for triggering the immune\\nsystem, resulting in the continuing and out-of-control\\ncycle of inflammation that occurs in Crohn’s disease.\\nOther evidence for a disorder of the immune system\\nincludes the high incidence of other immune disorders\\nthat may occur along with Crohn’s disease.\\nThe first symptoms of Crohn’s disease include diar-\\nrhea, fever, abdominal pain, inability to eat, weight loss,\\nand fatigue. Some patients have severe pain that mimics\\nappendicitis. It is rare, however, for patients to notice\\nblood in their bowel movements.

This\\nobstruction prevents the intestinal contents from passing\\nbeyond the point of the blockage. The intestinal contents\\n“back up,” resulting in constipation , vomiting, and\\nintense pain. Although rare in Crohn’s disease (because\\nof the increased thickness of the intestinal wall due to\\nswelling and scarring), a severe bowel obstruction can\\nresult in an intestinal wall perforation (a hole in the intes-\\ntine). Such a hole in the intestinal wall would allow the\\nintestinal contents, usually containing bacteria, to enter\\nthe abdomen. This complication could result in a severe,\\nlife-threatening infection.\\nAbcess formation is the development of a walled-off\\npocket of infection. A patient with an abscess will have\\nbouts of fever, increased abdominal pain, and may have a\\nlump or mass that can be felt through the wall of the\\nabdomen.\\nFistula formation is the formation of abnormal chan-\\nnels. These channels may connect one area of the intes-\\ntine to another neighboring section of intestine. Fistuals\\nmay join an area of the intestine to the vagina or bladder,\\nor they may drain an area of the intestine through the\\nskin. Abscesses and fistulas commonly affect the area\\naround the anus and rectum (the very last portions of the\\ncolon allowing waste to leave the body). These abnormal\\nconnections allow the bacteria that normally live in the\\nintestine to enter other areas of the body, causing poten-\\ntially serious infections.\\nPatients suffering from Crohn’s disease also have a\\nsignificant chance of experiencing other disorders. Some\\nof these may relate specifically to the intestinal disease,\\nand others appear to have some relationship to the imbal-\\nanced immune system.

Stool samples may be examined to make sure\\nthat no infectious agent is causing the diarrhea, and to\\nsee if the waste contains blood.\\nDuring an endoscopic exam, a doctor passes a flexi-\\nble tube with a tiny, fiber-optic camera device through\\nthe rectum and into the colon. The doctor can then care-\\nfully examine the lining of the intestine for signs of\\ninflammation and ulceration that might suggest Crohn’s\\ndisease. A tiny sample (a biopsy) of the intestine can\\nalso be taken through the endoscope, and the tissue will\\nbe examined under a microscope for evidence of\\nCrohn’s disease.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAbscess —A walled-off pocket of pus caused by\\ninfection.\\nEndoscope—A medical instrument that can be\\npassed into an area of the body (the bladder or\\nintestine, for example) to allow examination of\\nthat area. The endoscope usually has a fiber-optic\\ncamera that allows a greatly magnified image to\\nbe shown on a television screen viewed by the\\noperator. Many endoscopes also allow the opera-\\ntor to retrieve a small sample (biopsy) of the area\\nbeing examined to more closely view the tissue\\nunder a microscope.\\nFistule—An abnormal channel that creates an\\nopen passageway between two structures that do\\nnot normally connect.\\nGastrointestinal tract—The entire length of the\\ndigestive system, running from the stomach,\\nthrough the small intestine, large intestine, and out\\nthe rectum and anus.\\nImmune system—The body system responsible for\\nproducing various cells and chemicals that fight\\ninfection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other for-\\neign invaders. In autoimmune disease, these cells\\nand chemicals turn against the body itself.\\nInflammation—The result of the body’s attempts\\nto fight off and wall off an area that is infected.\\nInflammation results in the classic signs of red-\\nness, heat, swelling, and loss of function.\\nObstruction—A blockage.\\nUlceration—A pitted area or break in the continu-\\nity of a surface such as skin or mucous membrane.\\nX rays can be helpful for diagnosis, and also for\\ndetermining how much of the intestine is involved in the\\ndisease. For these x rays, the patient must either drink a\\nchalky solution containing barium, or receive a barium\\nenema (a solution that is administered through the rec-\\ntum). Barium helps to “light up” the intestine, allowing\\nmore detail to be seen on the resulting x rays.\\nWhile Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sim-\\nilar, they are also very different. Although it can be diffi-\\ncult to determine whether a patient has Crohn’s disease\\nor ulcerative colitis, it is important to make every effort\\nto distinguish between these two diseases. Because the\\nlong-term complications of the diseases are different,\\ntreatment will depend on careful diagnosis of the specific\\nIBD present.\\nTreatment\\nTreatments for Crohn’s disease try to reduce the\\nunderlying inflammation, the resulting malabsorption/\\nmalnutrition, the uncomfortable symptoms of crampy\\nabdominal pain and diarrhea, and the possible complica-\\ntions (obstructions, abscesses, and fistulas).\\nInflammation can be treated with a drug called sul-\\nfasalazine. Sulfasalazine is made up of two parts. One part\\nis related to the sulfa antibiotics; the other part is a form\\nof the anti-inflammatory chemical, salicylic acid (related\\nto aspirin). Sulfasalazine is not well absorbed from the\\nintestine, so it stays mostly within the intestine, where it is\\nbroken down into its components. It is believed that the\\nsalicylic acid component actively treats Crohn’s disease by\\nfighting inflammation. Some patients do not respond to\\nsulfasalazine, and require steroid medications (such as\\nprednisone). Steroids, however, must be used carefully to\\navoid the complications of these drugs, including\\nincreased risk of infection and weakening of bones (osteo-\\nporosis). Some very potent immunosuppressive drugs,\\nwhich interfere with the products of the immune system\\nand can hopefully decrease inflammation, may be used for\\nthose patients who do not improve on steroids.\\nA new drug called infliximab (Remicade) appears to\\nbe a powerful treatment for Crohn’s disease, particularly\\nfor patients who have not responded well to other forms\\nof treatment. Infliximab is administered through infusion,\\nand consists of a monoclonal antibody that interferes with\\nthe inflammatory process mediated by tumor necrosis\\nfactor-alpha (TNF-a). Patients taking infliximab seem to\\nbe able to decrease their use of steroid medications, and\\nrequire fewer surgical interventions. Furthermore, inflix-\\nimab is the first medication approved for treating fistulas.\\nUnfortunately, infliximab can only be used on a short-\\nterm basis, because its interference with TNF-a activity\\ncan also predispose patients to serious infection.

Some\\npatients find that certain foods are hard to digest, includ-\\ning milk, large quantities of fiber, and spicy foods. When\\npatients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri-\\nods of time when symptoms of the disease are at their\\nworst, they may need to drink specially formulated, high-\\ncalorie liquid supplements. Those patients who are\\nseverely ill may need to receive their nutrition through a\\nneedle inserted in a vein (intravenously), or even by a\\ntiny tube (a catheter) inserted directly into a major vein\\nin the chest.\\nA number of medications are available to help\\ndecrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn’s\\ndisease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium,\\nand codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose or\\npsyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do not\\ntolerate them well.\\nThe first step in treating an obstruction involves gen-\\neral attempts to decrease inflammation with sul-\\nfasalazine, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. A\\npatient with a severe obstruction will have to stop taking\\nall food and drink by mouth, allowing the bowel to\\n“rest.” Abscesses and other infections will require antibi-\\notics. Surgery may be required to repair an obstruction\\nthat does not resolve on its own, to remove an abscess, or\\nto repair a fistula. Such surgery may involve the removal\\nof a section of the intestine. In extremely severe cases of\\nCrohn’s disease that do not respond to treatment, a\\npatient may need to have the entire large intestine\\nremoved (an operation called a colectomy). In this case,\\na piece of the remaining small intestine is pulled through\\nan opening in the abdomen. This bit of intestine is fash-\\nioned surgically to allow a special bag to be placed over\\nit. This bag catches the body’s waste, which no longer\\ncan be passed through the large intestine and out of the\\nanus. This opening, which will remain in place for life, is\\ncalled an ileostomy.\\nPrognosis\\nCrohn’s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of\\nthe disease can vary, and a patient can experience periods\\nof time when the disease is not active and he or she is\\nsymptom-free. However, the complications and risks of\\nCrohn’s disease tend to increase over time. Well over\\n60% of all patients with Crohn’s disease will require\\nsurgery, and about half of these patients will require\\nmore than one operation over time. About 5–10% of all\\nCrohn’s patients will die of their disease, primarily due\\nto massive infection.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGlickman, Robert. “Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Ulcerative\\nColitis and Crohn’s Disease.” In Harrison’s Principles of\\nInternal Medicine, ed.

Croup is also\\nknown as laryngotracheitis, a medical term that describes\\nthe inflammation of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx.\\nParainfluenza viruses are the typical root cause of\\nthe infection, but influenza (flu) and cold viruses may\\nsometimes be responsible. All of these viruses are highly\\ncontagious and easily transmitted between individuals\\nvia sneezing and coughing. Children between the ages of\\nthree months and six years are usually affected, with the\\ngreatest incidence at one to two years of age. Croup can\\noccur at any time of the year, but it is most typical during\\nearly autumn and winter. The characteristic harsh bark-\\ning of a croupy cough can be very distressing, but it\\nrarely indicates a serious problem. Most children with\\ncroup can be treated very effectively at home; however,\\n1–5% may require medical treatment.\\nCroup may sometimes be confused with more seri-\\nous conditions, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis.\\nThese ailments arise from bacterial infection and must\\nreceive medical treatment.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOwing to an upper respiratory viral infection, the\\nlarynx and trachea may become inflamed or swollen. The\\nhallmark sign of croup is a harsh, barking cough. This\\ncough may be preceded by one to three days of symp-\\ntoms that resemble a slight cold. A croupy cough is often\\naccompanied by a runny nose, hoarseness, and a low\\nfever. When the child inhales, there may be a raspy or\\nhigh-pitched noise, called stridor, owing to the narrowed\\nairway and accumulated mucus. In the presence of stri-\\ndor, medical attention is required.\\nHowever, the airway rarely narrows so much that\\nbreathing is impeded. Symptoms usually abate complete-\\nly within a few days. Medical treatment may be sought if\\nthe child’s symptoms do not respond to home treatment.\\nEmergency medical treatment is required immediate-\\nly if the child has difficulty breathing, swallowing, or talk-\\ning; develops a high fever (103°F/39.4°C or more); seems\\nunalert or confused; or has pale or blue-tinged skin.\\nDiagnosis\\nCroup is diagnosed based on the symptoms. If\\nsymptoms are particularly severe, or do not respond to\\ntreatment, an x ray of the throat area is done to assess the\\npossibility of epiglottitis or other blockage of the airway.\\nTreatment\\nHome treatment is the usual method of managing\\ncroup symptoms. It is important that the child is kept\\ncomfortable and calm to the best degree possible, because\\ncrying can make symptoms seem worse. Humid air can\\nhelp a child with croup feel more comfortable. Recom-\\nmended methods include sitting in a steamy bathroom\\nwith the hot water running or using a cool-water vaporizer\\nor humidifier. Breathing may also be eased by going out-\\nside into cooler air. The child should drink frequently in\\norder to stay well hydrated. To treat any fever, the child\\nmay be given an appropriate dose of acetaminophen\\n(like Tylenol). Antihistamines and decongestants are\\nineffective in treating croup. Children under the age of 18\\nshould not be given aspirin, as it may causeReye’s syn-\\ndrome, a life-threatening disease of the brain.\\nIf the child does not respond to home treatment,\\nmedical treatment at a doctor’s office or an emergency\\nroom could be necessary. Based on the severity of symp-\\ntoms and the response to treatment, the child may need to\\nbe admitted to a hospital.\\nFor immediate symptom relief, epinephrine may be\\nadministered as an inhaled aerosol. Effects last for up to\\ntwo hours, but there is a possibility that symptoms may\\nreturn. For that reason, the child is kept under supervi-\\nsion for three or more hours. Another effective drug is a\\nglucocorticoid, dexamethasone. This drug requires more\\ntime to take effect, but is longer lasting. It can be admin-\\nistered orally or as an injection. Another glucocorticoid,\\nbudesonide, has been used outside the United States for\\ntreating croup. It is administered as an inhaled aerosol\\nand has been shown to be effective; however, it is not\\navailable as a treatment option in the United States.\\nOf the 1–5% of children requiring medical treat-\\nment, approximately 1% need respiratory support. Such\\nsupport involves intubation (inserting a tube into the tra-\\nchea) and oxygen administration.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBotanical/herbal medicines can be helpful in healing\\nthe cough that is commonly associated with croup. Sev-\\neral herbs to consider for cough treatment include\\naniseed (Pimpinella anisum ), sundew (Drosera rotundi-\\nfolia), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ), and wild cherry bark\\n(Prunus serotina ). Homeopathic medicine can be very\\neffective in treating cases of croup. Choosing the correct\\nremedy (a common choice is aconite or monkshood,\\nAconitum napellus) is always the key to the success of\\nthis type of treatment.\\nPrognosis\\nCroup is a temporary condition and children typically\\nrecover completely within three to six days. Children can\\nexperience one or more episodes of croup during early\\nchildhood; however, croup is rarely a dangerous condition.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n960\\nCroup'),\n",

The technique has been in\\nuse since the turn of the century, but modern techniques\\nhave made it widely available to dermatologists and pri-\\nmary care doctors. The technique is also called\\ncryosurgery.\\nPurpose\\nCryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of\\nbenign skin growths, such as warts, pre-cancerous lesions\\n(such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such as\\nbasal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal of\\ncryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growths\\nwhile preserving the surrounding skin from injury.\\nPrecautions\\nCryotherapy is not recommended for certain areas of\\nthe body because of the danger of destruction of tissue or\\nunacceptable scarring. These areas include: skin that\\noverlies nerves, the corners of the eyes, the fold of skin\\nbetween the nose and lip, the skin surrounding the nos-\\ntrils, and the border between the lips and the rest of the\\nface. Lesions that are suspected or known to be malig-\\nnant melanoma should not be treated with cryotherapy,\\nbut should instead be removed surgically. Similarly, basal\\ncell or squamous cell carcinomas that have reappeared at\\nthe site of a previously treated tumor should also be\\nremoved surgically. If it remains unclear whether a\\ngrowth is benign or malignant, a sample of tissue should\\nbe removed for analysis (biopsy) by a pathologist before\\nany attempts to destroy the lesion with cryotherapy. Care\\nshould be taken in people with diabetes or certain circula-\\ntion problems when cryotherapy is considered for\\ngrowths located on their lower legs, ankles, and feet. In\\nthese patients, healing can be poor and the risk of infec-\\ntion can be higher than for other patients.\\nDescription\\nThere are three main techniques to performing\\ncryotherapy.

The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quickly\\nas possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximum\\ndestruction of the skin cells. A second application may be\\nnecessary depending on the size of the growth. In another\\ncryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a small\\nspray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto the\\nskin growth.

It is one of the dis-\\neases most often affecting AIDS patients. Cryptococco-\\nsis may be limited to the lungs, but frequently spreads\\nthroughout the body. Although almost any organ can be\\ninfected, the fungus is often fatal if it infects the nervous\\nsystem where it causes an inflammation of the mem-\\nbranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).\\nDescription\\nThe fungus causing cryptococcus,C. neoformans,i s\\nfound worldwide in soil contaminated with pigeon or\\nother bird droppings. It has also been found on unwashed\\nraw fruit. Cryptococcosis is a rare disease in healthy\\nindividuals, but is the most common fungal infection\\naffecting people with AIDS.\\nPeople with Hodgkin’s disease or who are taking\\nlarge doses of drugs that suppress the functioning of the\\nimmune system (corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs)\\nare also more susceptible to cryptococcal infection.\\nCryptococcosis is also called cryptococcal meningitis\\n(when the brain is infected), Busse-Buschke disease,\\nEuropean blastomycosis, torular meningitis, or torulosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOnce the cryptococcal fungus reaches the lungs,\\nthree things can happen. The immune system can heal\\nthe body without medical intervention, the disease can\\nstay localized in the lungs, or it can spread throughout\\nthe body. In healthy people with normally functioning\\nimmune systems, the body usually heals itself, and the\\ninfected person notices no symptoms and has no compli-\\ncations (asymptomatic). The disease does not spread\\nfrom one person to another.\\nCryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection that\\nputs people with immune system diseases at higher risk\\nof developing more serious forms of the disease. In the\\nUnited States, 6–10% of all patients with AIDS get cryp-\\ntococcosis.\\nIf the body does not heal itself, the fungus begins to\\ngrow in the lungs and form nodules that can be seen on\\nchest x rays. In the early stages of infection, an individ-\\nual usually only exhibits symptoms of a respiratory\\ninfection, such as a dry cough, so the disease is rarely\\ndiagnosed.\\nThe fungus can remain dormant in the lungs and\\nproduce an active infection later if the immune system is\\nweakened. If the disease becomes active, it can cause\\ncryptococcal pneumonia in the lungs. Unfortunately,\\nhowever, cryptococcal pneumonia has symptoms similar\\nto other pneumonias (cough, chest pain, difficulty\\nbreathing), making it difficult to accurately diagnose.\\nThe infection can spread to other parts of the body, par-\\nticularly the brain and central nervous system.\\nMost patients are not diagnosed as having crypto-\\ncoccosis until they show signs of cryptococcal meningi-\\ntis, or infection of the membranes surrounding the brain\\nand spinal cord. Symptoms appear gradually over a peri-\\nod of two to four weeks. Fever and headache are the\\nmost common symptoms, occurring in about 85% of\\npatients. Nausea, vomiting, unwanted weight loss, and\\nfatigueare also common. Other symptoms seen in\\n25–30% of patients are blurred vision, stiff neck, aver-\\nsion to light, and seizures.

In\\naddition to meningitis, inflammation of the brain\\n(encephalitis ) and brain lesions called cryptococcomas\\nor tortulomas can also develop.\\nIn addition to the brain, the cryptococcal infection\\ncan spread to the kidneys, bone marrow, heart, adrenal\\nglands, lymph nodes, urinary tract, blood, and skin.\\nOften times preceding the development of cryptococcal\\nmeningitis, painless rashes and lesions that mimic other\\nskin diseases, such as molluscum contagiosum , may\\ndevelop. A small percentage of patients with brain infec-\\ntions show infections in other organs as well.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians who regularly work with AIDS patients\\nhave the most experience in diagnosing cryptococcosis.\\nThe preferred methods of diagnosis use simple and very\\naccurate blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests that\\ndetect the presence of an antigen produced by the fungus.\\nThe cerebrospinal fluid test is generally more sensitive to\\ndetecting the meningitis form of the infection. CSF is\\ncollected during a procedure called a lumbar puncture,\\nduring which an anesthetic is applied to a small area of\\nthe back near the spine and a needle is used to withdraw\\na sample of cerebrospinal fluid from the space between\\nthe vertebrae and the spinal cord. Once obtained, a small\\namount of ink (called India ink) is added to a sample of\\nCSF or a sample prepared from skin lesions . If the fun-\\ngus is present, it will become visible when the ink binds\\nto the capsule or covering that surrounds the fungus.\\nFaster results are obtained with the India ink test, but it is\\nless accurate than the blood test (75–85% accuracy com-\\npared to 99% accuracy with the blood test) because some\\nstrains are not visible using this method. Antigen tests\\nare routinely recommended for non-symptomatic\\npatients with advanced AIDS.\\nAnother way to diagnose cryptococcosis is to cul-\\nture a sample of sputum, tissue from a lung biopsy ,o r\\nCSF in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. Cultures are\\nalso done to assess the effectiveness of treatment.\\nChest x rays are useful in assessing lung damage and\\nmay reveal a single mass or multiple distinct nodules, but\\nthe x ray alone does not lead to a definitive diagnosis of\\ncryptococcosis.\\nTreatment\\nOnce cryptococcosis is diagnosed, treatment begins\\nwith amphotericin B (Fungizone), sometimes in combi-\\nnation with 5-flucytosine (Ancobon). Amphotericin B is\\na powerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic side\\neffects, such as kidney toxicity and lower concentrations\\nof an important blood component called hemoglobin.\\nThis medication can also cause fever, chills,nausea and\\nvomiting, diarrhea, headache, and muscle aches. Treat-\\nment is generally given intravenously during a hospital\\nstay and continues until the patient is stable or improving\\n(no more than two to three weeks). 5-flucytosine is given\\norally. Patients may also receive other medication to\\nminimize the side effects from these drugs.\\nAmphotericin B, with or without 5-flucytosine, is\\ngiven for several weeks until the patient is stable, after\\nwhich the patient receives oral fluconazole (Diflucan).\\nFluconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug with few\\nserious side effects. Patient with AIDS must continue tak-\\ning fluconazole for the rest of their lives to prevent a\\nrelapse of cryptococcosis. Sometimes fluconazole is\\ngiven to patients with advanced AIDS as a preventative\\n(prophylactic) measure.\\nBecause of the high cost of fluconazole, the manu-\\nfacturer of the drug, Pfizer, has established a financial\\nassistance plan to make the drug available at lower cost\\nto those who meet certain criteria. Patients needing this\\ndrug should ask their doctors about this program.\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated cryptococcosis is always fatal. The acute\\nmortality rate for patients with AIDS is 10–25%. Most\\ndeaths are attributable to cryptococcal meningitis and\\noccur within two weeks after diagnosis. For AIDS\\npatients who do not receive continued suppressive thera-\\npy (fluconazole), the relapse rate is 50–60% within six\\nmonths and a shortened life expectancy.

Protozoa are\\na group of parasites that infect the human intestine, and\\ninclude the better known Giardia. Cryptosporidiawas first\\nidentified in 1976 as a cause of disease in humans.\\nDescription\\nCryptosporidiaare normally passed in the feces of\\ninfected persons and animals in the form of cysts. The\\ncysts can remain in the ground and water for months, and\\nwhen ingested produce symptoms after maturing in the\\nintestine and the bile ducts. When viewed under the\\nmicroscope, they appear as small bluish-staining round\\nbodies. Most common sources of infection are other\\nhumans, water supplies, or reservoirs. These are contam-\\ninated by animals that defecate in these areas. An out-\\nbreak in Milwaukee in 1993 in which over 400,000 per-\\nsons were affected was traced to the city’s water supply.\\nCysts of Cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to the\\ndisinfectants that are commonly used in most water treat-\\nment plants and are incompletely removed by filtration.\\nMost persons who experience significant symptoms\\nhave an altered immune system, and suffer from diseases\\nsuch as AIDS and cancer. However, as shown in the\\nMilwaukee outbreak, even those with normal immunity\\ncan experience symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCysts of Cryptosporidia mature in the intestine and\\nbile ducts within three to five days of ingestion. As noted,\\nlarge-scale infections from contaminated water supplies\\nhas been documented. However, human to human trans-\\nmission (such as occurs in day care centers or through\\nsexual behavior) is also an important cause.\\nMany individuals can be infected without any ill-\\nness, but the major symptom is diarrhea, which is often\\nwatery and incapacitating. Dehydration , low-grade\\nfever, nausea, and abdominal cramps are frequent.\\nIn those with a normal immune system, the disease\\nusually lasts about 10 days. For patients with altered immu-\\nnity (immunocompromised), the story is quite different,\\nwith diarrhea becoming chronic, debilitating, and even fatal.\\nComplications\\nDehydration and malnutrition are the most com-\\nmon effects of infection. In about 20% of AIDS patients,\\nbile duct infection also occurs and causes symptoms sim-\\nilar to gallbladder attacks. Eighty percent or more of\\nthose with infection of the bile ducts die from the dis-\\nease. The lungs and pancreas are also sometimes\\ninvolved. Cryptosporidia are just one cause of the diar-\\nrhea wasting syndrome in AIDS, which results in severe\\nweight loss and malnutrition.\\nDiagnosis\\nThis is based on either finding the characteristic\\ncysts in stool specimens, or on biopsy of an infected\\norgan, such as the intestine.\\nTreatment\\nThe first aim of treatment is to avoid dehydration.\\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids\\nmay be needed. Medications used to treat diarrhea by\\ndecreasing intestinal motility (Anti-Motility Agents),\\nsuch as loperamide or diphenoxylate, are also useful, but\\nshould only be used with the advice of a physician.\\nTreatment aimed directly at Cryptosporidia is only\\npartially effective, and rarely eliminates the organism.\\nThe medication most commonly used is paromomycin\\n(Humatin), but others are presently under evaluation.\\nPrognosis\\nCryptosporidiararely cause a serious disease in per-\\nsons with normal immune systems. Replacement of fluids\\nis all that is usually needed. On the other hand, those with\\naltered immune systems often suffer for months to years.\\nParamomycin and other drugs have been able to improve\\nsymptoms in over half of those treated. Unfortunately,\\nmany organisms are resistant, and recurrence is frequent.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to prevent cryptosporidiosis is to mini-\\nmize exposure to cysts from infected humans and ani-\\nmals. Proper hand washing technique, especially in day\\ncare centers, is recommended.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDavis, Charles E. “Laboratory Diagnosis of Parasitic Infec-\\ntion.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,e d .\\nAnthony S.

The disorder, which leads to a vari-\\nety of symptoms and physical abnormalities, is most\\ncommonly caused by taking medications containing the\\nhormone over a long period of time. A more rare form of\\nthe disorder occurs when the body itself produces an\\nexcessive amount of cortisol.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each of which is perched\\non the upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the\\ngland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the\\nmedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is respon-\\nsible for producing different types of hormones. Regulation\\nof hormone production and release from the adrenal cortex\\ninvolves the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the\\nbase of the brain. After the hypothalamus (the part of the\\nbrain containing secretions important to metabolic activi-\\nties) sends “releasing hormones” to the pituitary gland, the\\npituitary secretes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic\\nhormone (ACTH). The ACTH then travels through the\\nbloodstream to the adrenal cortex, where it encourages the\\nproduction and release of cortisol (sometimes called the\\n“stress” hormone) and other adrenocortical hormones.\\nCortisol, a very potent glucocorticoid—a group of\\nadrenocortical hormones that protects the body from\\nstressand affect protein and carbohydrate metabolism—\\nis involved in regulating the functioning of nearly every\\ntype of organ and tissue in the body, and is considered to\\nbe one of the few hormones absolutely necessary for life.\\nCortisol is involved in:\\n• complex processing and utilization of many nutrients,\\nincluding sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• normal functioning of the circulatory system and the\\nheart\\n• functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells\\n• normal processes involved in maintaining the skeletal\\nsystem\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• normal responses of the immune system\\nCushing’s syndrome, also called hypercortisolism,\\nhas an adverse effect on all of the processes described\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2970\\nCushing’s syndrome'),\n",

The syndrome occurs in approximately 10 to 15\\nout of every one million people per year, usually striking\\nadults between the ages of 20 and 50.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is\\nthe long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones in medica-\\ntions. Medications such as prednisone are used in a num-\\nber of inflammatory conditions. Such conditions include\\nrheumatoid arthritis, asthma, vasculitis , lupus, and a\\nvariety of other autoimmune disorders in which the\\nbody’s immune cells accidentally attack some part of the\\nbody itself. In these disorders, the glucocorticoids are\\nused to dampen the immune response, thereby decreas-\\ning damage to the body.\\nCushing’s syndrome can also be caused by three dif-\\nferent categories of disease:\\n• a pituitary tumor producing abnormally large quantities\\nof ACTH\\n• the abnormal production of ACTH by some source\\nother than the pituitary\\n• a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol\\nAlthough it is rare, about two-thirds of endoge-\\nnous (occurring within the body rather than from a\\nsource outside the body, like a medication) Cushing’s\\nsyndrome is a result of Cushing’s disease. The term\\n“Cushing’s disease” refers to Cushing’s syndrome,\\nwhich is caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by a\\npituitary tumor, usually an adenoma (noncancerous\\ntumor). The pituitary tumor causes increased growth of\\nthe adrenal cortex (hyperplasia) and increased cortisol\\nproduction. Cushing’s disease affects women more\\noften than men.\\nTumors in locations other than the pituitary can also\\nproduce ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH syndrome\\n(“ectopic” refers to something existing out of its normal\\nplace). Tumors in the lung account for more than half of\\nall cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other types of\\ntumors that may produce ACTH include tumors of the\\nthymus, the pancreas, the thyroid, and the adrenal gland.\\nNearly all adrenal gland tumors are benign (noncancer-\\nous), although in rare instances a tumor may actually be\\ncancerous.\\nSymptoms of cortisol excess (resulting from med-\\nication or from the body’s excess production of the hor-\\nmone) include:\\n• weight gain\\n• an abnormal accumulation of fatty pads in the face (cre-\\nating the distinctive “moon face” of Cushing’s syn-\\ndrome); in the trunk (termed “truncal obesity”); and\\nover the upper back and the back of the neck (giving the\\nindividual what has been called a “buffalo hump”)\\n• purple and pink stretch marks across the abdomen and\\nflanks\\n• high blood pressure\\n• weak, thinning bones (osteoporosis)\\n• weak muscles\\n• low energy\\n• thin, fragile skin, with a tendency toward both bruising\\nand slow healing\\n• abnormalities in the processing of sugars (glucose),\\nwith occasional development of actual diabetes\\n• kidney stones\\n• increased risk of infections\\n• emotional disturbances, including mood swings, depres-\\nsion, irritability, confusion, or even a complete break\\nwith reality (psychosis)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n971\\nCushing’s syndrome\\nWoman with Cushing’s syndrome.(Photo Researchers, Inc.\\nReproduced by permission.)'),\n",

Fol-\\nlowing a review of the patient’s medical history,physical\\nexamination , and routine blood tests, a series of more\\nsophisticated tests is available to achieve a diagnosis.\\n24-hour free cortisol test\\nThis is the most specific diagnostic test for identify-\\ning Cushing’s syndrome. It involves measuring the\\namount of cortisol present in the urine over a 24-hour\\nperiod. When excess cortisol is present in the blood-\\nstream, it is processed by the kidneys and removed as\\nwaste in the urine. This 24-hour free cortisol test requires\\nthat an individual collect exactly 24-hours’ worth of\\nurine in a single container. The urine is then analyzed in\\na laboratory to determine the quantity of cortisol present.\\nThis technique can also be paired with the administration\\nof dexamethasone, which in a normal individual would\\ncause urine cortisol to be very low. Once a diagnosis has\\nbeen made using the 24-hour free cortisol test, other tests\\nare used to find the exact location of the abnormality\\ncausing excess cortisol production.\\nDexamethasone suppression test\\nThis test is useful in distinguishing individuals with\\nexcess ACTH production due to a pituitary adenoma\\nfrom those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.\\nPatients are given dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocor-\\nticoid) orally every six hours for four days. Low doses of\\ndexamethasone are given during the first two days; for\\nthe last two days, higher doses are administered. Before\\ndexamethasone is administered, as well as on each day of\\nthe test, 24-hour urine collections are obtained.\\nBecause cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the\\npituitary to decrease ACTH, the normal response after\\ntaking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine corti-\\nsol levels. Thus, the cortisol response to dexamethasone\\ndiffers depending on whether the cause of Cushing’s syn-\\ndrome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-pro-\\nducing tumor.\\nHowever, the dexamethasone suppression test may\\nproduce false-positive results in patients with conditions\\nsuch as depression, alcohol abuse, high estrogen levels,\\nacute illness, and stress. On the other hand, drugs such as\\nphenytoin and phenobarbital may produce false-negative\\nresults.

In this test, patients are given\\nan injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hor-\\nmone that causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. In\\npatients with pituitary adenomas, blood levels of ACTH\\nand cortisol usually rise. However, in patients with\\nectopic ACTH syndrome, this rise is rarely seen. In\\npatients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors, this rise\\nalmost never occurs.\\nPetrosal sinus sampling\\nAlthough this test is not always necessary, it may be\\nused to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and an\\nectopic source of ACTH. Petrosal sinus sampling involves\\ndrawing blood directly from veins that drain the pituitary.\\nThis test, which is usually performed with local anesthe-\\nsia and mild sedation, requires inserting tiny, flexible\\ntubes (catheters) through a vein in the upper thigh or\\ngroin area. The catheters are then threaded up slowly until\\nthey reach veins in an area of the skull known as the pet-\\nrosal sinuses. X rays are typically used to confirm the cor-\\nrect position of the catheters. Often CRH is also given\\nduring the test to increase the accuracy of results.\\nWhen blood tested from the petrosal sinuses reveals\\na higher ACTH level than blood drawn from a vein in the\\nforearm, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma.\\nWhen the two samples show similar levels of ACTH, the\\ndiagnosis indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome.\\nRadiologic imaging tests\\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only\\nused to look at the pituitary and adrenal glands after a\\nfirm diagnosis has already been made. The presence of a\\npituitary or adrenal tumor does not necessarily guarantee\\nthat it is the source of increased ACTH production. Many\\nhealthy people with no symptoms or disease whatsoever\\nhave noncancerous tumors in the pituitary and adrenal\\nglands. Thus, CT and MRI is often used to image the\\npituitary and adrenal glands in preparation for surgery.\\nTreatment\\nThe choice of a specific treatment depends on the\\ntype of problem causing the cortisol excess. Pituitary and\\nadrenal adenomas are usually removed surgically. Malig-\\nnant adrenal tumors always require surgical removal.\\nTreatment of ectopic ACTH syndrome also involves\\nremoving all of the cancerous cells that are producing\\nACTH. This may be done through surgery,chemothera-\\npy (using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi-\\nation therapy (using x rays to kill cancer cells), depend-\\ning on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Radi-\\nation therapy may also be used on the pituitary (with or\\nwithout surgery) for patients who cannot undergo\\nsurgery, or for patients whose surgery did not successful-\\nly decrease pituitary release of ACTH.\\nThere are a number of drugs that are effective in\\ndecreasing adrenal production of cortisol. These medica-\\ntions include mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone,\\ntrilostane, aminoglutethimide, and mifepristone . These\\ndrugs are sometimes given prior to surgery in an effort to\\nreverse the problems brought on by cortisol excess. How-\\never, the drugs may also need to be administered after\\nsurgery (sometimes along with radiation treatments) in\\npatients who continue to have excess pituitary production\\nof ACTH.\\nBecause pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to\\ndrop too low, some patients require short-term treatment\\nwith a cortisol-like medication after surgery. Patients\\nwho need adrenal surgery may also require glucocorti-\\ncoid replacement. If the entire adrenal gland has been\\nremoved, the patient must take oral glucocorticoids for\\nthe rest of his or her life.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends on the source of the problem.\\nWhen pituitary adenomas are identified as the source of\\nincreased ACTH leading to cortisol excess, about 80% of\\npatients are cured by surgery. When cortisol excess is\\ndue to some other form of cancer, the prognosis depends\\non the type of cancer and the extent of its spread.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBrickner, Colleen.

Humans can pick up the infec-\\ntion by walking barefoot on soil or beaches contaminated\\nwith animal feces.\\nDescription\\nCutaneous larvae migrans (also called “creeping\\neruption” or “ground itch”) is found in southeastern and\\nGulf states, and in tropical developing countries.\\nThe hookworms that cause the condition are small,\\nround blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 million\\npeople around the world. Cutaneous larvae migrans\\noccurs most often among children, those who crawl\\nbeneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie down\\non wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAfter an animal passes feces that are infested with\\nhookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae that\\nare able to penetrate human skin (even through solid\\nmaterial, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common-\\nly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach-\\nes, a child’s sandbox, or areas underneath a house),\\nwhere they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks.\\nIn minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at\\nall. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin\\n(papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae have\\npenetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas that\\nare in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, and\\nbuttocks.\\nBetween a few days and a few months after infec-\\ntion, the larvae begin to migrate beneath the skin, leaving\\nextremely itchy red lines that may be accompanied by\\nblisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of the\\nsole of the foot or on the buttocks.\\nTyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to\\nthe lungs, and then migrate into the mouth where they are\\nswallowed and attach to the small intestine lining. There\\nthey mature into adult worms. In cases where the larvae\\nmigrate through the lungs, they can produce anemia,\\ncough, and pneumonia, in addition to the itchy rash.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe condition can be diagnosed by microscopic\\ninspection of feces which can reveal hookworm eggs. In\\naddition visual inspection of the skin would reveal tell-\\ntale itchy red lines and blisters.\\nTreatment\\nPeople without intestinal symptoms do not need\\ntreatment, since the worms will eventually die or be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n974\\nCutaneous larva migrans'),\n",

This disease involves\\nthe uncontrollable proliferation of T-lymphocytes known\\nas T-helper cells, so named because of their role in the\\nimmune response. T-helper cells are characterized by the\\npresence of a protein receptor on its surface called CD4.\\nAccordingly, T-helper cells are said to be CD4+.\\nThe proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen-\\netration, or infiltration, of these abnormal cells into the\\nepidermal layer of the skin. The skin reacts with slightly\\nscaling lesions that itch, although the sites of greatest\\ninfiltration do not necessarily correspond to the sites of\\nthe lesions. The lesions are most often located on the\\ntrunk, but can be present on any part of the body. In the\\nmost common course of the disease, the patchy lesions\\nprogress to palpable plaques that are deeper red and have\\nmore defined edges. As the disease worsens, skin tumors\\ndevelop that are often mushroom-shaped, hence the\\nname mycosis fungoides. Finally, the cancer progresses\\nto extracutanous involvement, often in the lymph nodes\\nor the viscera.\\nCTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of\\nabout 0.29 cases per 100,000 persons in the United\\nStates. It is about half as common in Eastern Europe.\\nHowever, this discrepancy may be attributed to a differ-\\ning physician awareness of the disease rather than a true\\ndifference in occurrence. In the Unites States, there are\\nabout 500 to 600 new cases a year and about 100 to 200\\ndeaths. Usually seen in older adults, the median age at\\ndiagnosis is 55 to 60 years, and it strikes twice as many\\nmen as women.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of CTCL is unknown. Exposure to chemi-\\ncals or pesticides has been suggested but the most recent\\nstudy on the subject failed to show a connection between\\nexposure and development of the disease. The ability to\\nisolate various viruses from cell lines grown from cells of\\nCTCL patients raises the question of a viral cause, but\\nstudies have been unable to confirm these suspicions.\\nThe symptoms of CTCL are seen primarily in the\\nskin, with itchy red patches or plaques and, usually over\\ntime, mushroom-shaped skin tumors. Any part of the\\nskin can be involved and the extent and distribution of\\nthe rash or tumors vary greatly from patient to patient.\\nThe only really universal symptom of the disease is the\\nitch and this symptom is usually what brings the patient\\nto the doctor for treatment.

Spread to the viscera is most\\noften manifested as disorders of the lungs, upper diges-\\ntive tract, central nervous system, or liver but virtually\\nany organ can be shown to be involved at autopsy.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of CTCL is often difficult in the early\\nstages because of its slow progression and ability to\\nmimic many other benign skin conditions. The early\\npatches of CTCL resemble eczema,psoriasis, and con-\\ntact dermatitis. In a further complication, the early man-\\nifestations of the disease can respond favorably to the\\ntopical corticosteroid treatments prescribed for these skin\\ndisorders. This has the unfortunate result of the disease\\nbeing missed and the patient remaining untreated for\\nyears. CTCL is most likely discovered when a physician\\nmaintains a suspicion about the disease, performs multi-\\nple skin biopsies, and provides close follow-up after the\\ninitial presentation.\\nSkin biopsies showing penetration of abnormal cells\\ninto the epidermal tissue are necessary to make a firm\\ndiagnosis of CTCL. Several molecular studies can also\\nhelp support the diagnosis. The first looks at the cellular\\nproteins seen on the surface of the abnormal cells. Many\\ncases of CTCL show the retention of the CD4+ protein,\\nbut the loss of other proteins usually seen on the surface\\nof mature CD4+ cells, such as Leu-8 or Leu-9. The\\nabnormal cells also show unusual rearrangements at the\\ngenetic level for the gene that encodes the T-cell recep-\\ntors. These rearrangements can be identified using\\nSouthern blot analysis. The information from the molec-\\nular tests, combined with the presence of abnormal cells\\nin the epidermis, strongly supports the CTCL diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of CTCL depends on the stage of the dis-\\nease. The current staging of this disease was first presented\\nat the International Consensus Conference on CTCL in\\n1997. The staging attempts to show the complex interac-\\ntion between the various outward symptoms of the disease\\nand prognosis. The system has seven clinical stages based\\non skin involvement (tumor = T), lymph node involvement\\n(LN), and presence of visceral metastases (M).\\nThe first stage, IA, is characterized by plaques cov-\\nering less than 10% of the body (T1) and no visceral\\ninvolvement (M0). Lymph node condition at this stage\\ncan be uninvolved, reactive to the skin disease, or der-\\nmatopathic (biopsies showing CTCL involvement) but\\nnot enlarged (LN0-2). The shorthand expression of this\\nstage is therefore T1, LN0-2, M0. The next stage, IB, dif-\\nfers from IA in that greater than 10% of the body is cov-\\nered by plaques (T2, LN0-2, M0). Stage IIA occurs with\\nany amount of plaques in addition to the ability to pal-\\npate the lymph node and the lymph uninvolved, reactive,\\nor dermatopathic (T1-2, LN0-2, M0).\\nTreatments applied to the skin are preferred for\\npatients having these preliminary stages of the disease,\\ncommonly topical chemotherapy with mechlorethamine\\nhydrochloride (nitrogen mustard) or phototherapy of\\npsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUV A). Topical chemothera-\\npy involves application to the skin of nitrogen mustard,\\nan alkylating agent, in a concentration of 10–20 mg/dL\\nin an aqueous or ointment base. Treatment of affected\\nskin is suggested at a minimum and application over the\\nentire skin surface is often recommended. Care needs to\\nbe taken that coverage of involved skin is adequate, as\\npatients who self-apply the drug often cannot reach all\\naffected areas. The most common side effect is skin\\nhypersensitivity to the drug. Nearly all patients respond\\nfavorably to this treatment, with a 32–61% complete\\nresponse rate, based on amount of skin involvement.\\nUnfortunately, only 10–15% of patients maintain a com-\\nplete response rate after discontinuing the treatment.\\nPhototherapy involves treatment with an orally\\nadministered drug, 8-methyloxypsoralen, that renders the\\nskin sensitive to long-wave ultraviolet light (UV A), fol-\\nlowed by controlled exposure to the radiation. During the\\ninitial treatment period, which may last as long as six\\nmonths, patients are treated two to three times weekly.\\nThis is reduced to about once monthly after initial clear-\\ning of the lesions. Redness of the skin and blistering are\\nthe most common side effects of the treatment and are\\nmuch more common in patients presenting with overall\\nskin redness, or erythroderma, so lower intensities of\\nlight are usually used in this case. About 50% of all\\npatients experience complete clearance with this treat-\\nment. Some patients with very fair skin and limited skin\\ninvolvement can successfully treat themselves at home\\nwith special lamps and no psoralen.\\nThe next stage, IIB, involves one or more cutaneous\\ntumors, in combination with absent or present palpable\\nlymph nodes, lymph uninvolved, reactive, or dermatopath-\\nic, and no visceral involvement (T3, LN0-2, M0). Stage III\\nis characterized by erythroderma, an abnormal redness\\nover widespread areas of the skin (T4, LN0-2, M0).\\nFor more extensive disease, radiation therapy is an\\neffective treatment option. It is generally used after the\\ntopical treatments have proven ineffective. Individual\\nplaques or tumors can be treated using electrons, ortho-\\nvoltage x rays, or megavoltage photons with exposure in\\nthe range of 15 to 25 Gy.

Loose skin, the\\nprimary and most obvious symptom of these diseases, is\\ncaused by underlying defects in connective tissue struc-\\nture, which also cause more serious internal problems in\\nvocal cords, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, kid-\\nney, digestive system, and lungs. The loose skin is partic-\\nularly obvious on the face, and children with the disorder\\nlook sad or mournful.\\nThere are four genetic forms of the disease: sex-\\nlinked, autosomal dominant, and two types of autosomal\\nrecessive inheritance. The recessive forms are the most\\ncommon and are usually more severe than the other forms.\\nCauses and Symptoms\\nSex-linked cutis laxa is caused by a defective gene on\\nthe X chromosome. In addition to loose skin, its symp-\\ntoms are mild mental retardation , loose joints, bone\\nabnormalities (like hooked nose, pigeon breast, and fun-\\nnel breast), frequent loose stools, urinary tract blockages,\\nand deficiencies in lysyl oxidase, an enzyme required for\\nthe formation of properly functioning connective tissue.\\n(But the defective gene does not code for lysyl oxidase.)\\nAutosomal dominant cutis laxa is caused by a defec-\\ntive gene carried on an autosomal (not sex-linked) chro-\\nmosome. Its symptoms are loose, hanging skin, missing\\nelastic fibers, premature aging, and pulmonary emphy-\\nsema. Only a few families are known with cutis laxa\\ninherited as a dominant trait.\\nAutosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1 is caused by a\\ndefective gene on chromosome 5. Symptoms include\\nemphysema; diverticula in the esophagus, duodenum,\\nand bladder; lax and dislocated joints; tortuous arteries;\\nhernias; lysyl oxidase deficiencies; and retarded growth.\\nAutosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 is also inherit-\\ned as a recessive trait. In addition to the loose skin, this\\nform of the disease is characterized by bone abnormali-\\nties, the delayed joining of the cranial (skull) bones, hip\\ndislocation, curvature of the spine, flat feet, and exces-\\nsive tooth decay.\\nAcquired cutis laxa tends to follow (and may be\\ncaused by) severe illness characterized by fever, inflam-\\nmation, and a severe skin rash ( erythema multiforme );\\nan injury to the nerves that control blood vessel dilation\\nand contraction; or an autoimmune condition.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe signs of cutis laxa are very obvious, and it is\\nusually easy to diagnose by examining the skin. The\\ndetermination of which form of cutis laxa is present is\\naided by information about the associated symptoms and\\nby family histories.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no effective cure for any of these disorders.\\nComplications are treated by appropriate specialists, for\\nexample, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatolo-\\ngists, and dermatologists. Plastic surgery can be helpful for\\ncosmetic purposes, but the skin may become loose again.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for cutis laxa varies with the form of\\nthe disorder. The effects may be relatively mild with indi-\\nviduals living a fairly normal, full life, or the disease may\\nbe fatal.\\nPrevention\\nThe inherited forms of cutis laxa are genetically\\ndetermined and are not currently preventable. Genetic\\ncounseling can be helpful for anyone with a family his-\\ntory of cutis laxa. The cause of acquired cutis laxa is not\\nknown, so no preventive measures can be taken.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPope, F.

So many diseases can cause vomiting—from\\nbowel obstruction to epilepsy—that an accurate and time-\\nly diagnosis is critical.

Protozoa are a\\ngroup of parasites that infect the human intestine. Para-\\nsites are organisms that live in another body, called the\\nhost, and get food and liquids from that host. This para-\\nsite is a member of the group of protozoa known as coc-\\ncidia, to which Cryptosporidia also belongs. This group\\nof parasites infects the human intestine, and causes\\nchronic recurrent infections in those with altered immu-\\nnity or AIDS. Even in people with normal immune func-\\ntion, Cyclopsora can cause prolonged bouts of diarrhea\\nand other gastrointestinal symptoms.\\nDescription\\nUntil recently,Cyclospora was considered to be a\\nform of algae. The parasite causes a common form of\\nwaterborne infectious diarrhea throughout the world. Just\\nhow the parasite gets into water sources is not yet clear. It\\nis known that ingestion of small cysts in contaminated\\nwater leads to disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSymptoms begin after an incubation period of about a\\nday or so following ingestion of cysts. A brief period of flu-\\nlike illness characterized by weakness and low-grade fever\\nis followed by watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and\\nmuscle aches. In some patients, symptoms may wax and\\nwane for weeks, and there are those in whom nausea and\\nburping may predominate.

This can worsen the con-\\ndition of a patient with dysentery or colitis.\\nCyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or\\nthe cell of an organism. The cyst enables many\\norganisms to survive in the environment for long\\nperiods of time without need for food or water.\\nImmunocompromised—A change or alteration of\\nthe immune system that normally serves to fight\\noff infections other illnesses. This can involve\\nchanges in antibodies that the body produces\\n(hygogammaglobulinemia), or a defect in the cells\\nthat partake in the immune response. Diseases\\nsuch as AIDS and cancer exhibit changes in the\\nbody’s natural immunity.\\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS)—A liquid\\npreparation developed by the World Health Orga-\\nnization that can decrease fluid loss in persons\\nwith diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre-\\npared with materials available in the home, com-\\nmercial preparations have recently come into use.\\nParasite—An organism that lives on or in another\\nand takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that\\norganism.\\nProtozoa—Group of extremely small single cell\\n(unicellular) or acellular organisms that are found\\nin moist soil or water. They tend to exist as para-\\nsites, living off other life forms.\\nSpore—A resistant form of certain species of bac-\\nteria, protozoa, and other organisms.\\nThe use of the medication, trimethoprim-sulfameth-\\noxazole (Bactrim) for one week can be successful in\\ntreating intestinal infections and prevents relapse in those\\nwith a normal immune system. The same medicine can\\nbe prescribed to treat infections of both the intestine or\\nbile ducts in immunocompromised individuals, but main-\\ntenance or continuous treatment is often needed.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outlook is quite good for individuals in whom a\\ndiagnosis is made. Even without treatment, symptoms\\nusually do not last much more than a month or so except\\nin cases with altered immunity. Fortunately, treatment is\\nusually successful even in those patients.\\nPrevention\\nAside from a waterborne source as the origin of\\ninfection, little else is known about how the parasite is\\ntransmitted.

Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat\\nbladder cancer. Surgery is used to remove cancer when\\nit is in the muscle of the bladder.\\nPrecautions\\nCystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not\\nbe appropriate for patients with superficial tumors that\\nrespond to more conservative treatment.\\nDescription\\nCystectomy is a major surgical operation. The\\npatient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is\\nmade across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located,\\ntied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad-\\nder. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The\\nbladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the\\nprostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the\\nuterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are\\nremoved with the bladder. The bladder collects urine\\nfrom the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the\\nbladder is removed, a new method must be created to\\nremove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is\\nremoved, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The\\nother end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the\\nabdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con-\\nnected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now\\nflows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the\\nstoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine.\\nPreparation\\nThe medical team will discuss the procedure and tell\\nthe patient where the stoma will appear and what it will\\nlook like. The patient receives instruction on caring for a\\nstoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period of\\nfastingand an enema may be required.\\nKEY TERMS\\nUreters —Tubes that connect the kidneys to the\\nbladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passes\\nthrough the ureters to the bladder.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the operation, the patient is given fluid-based\\nnutrition until the intestines being to function normally\\nagain. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the\\nincision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean\\nthat there will be major lifestyle changes for the person\\nundergoing the operation. Men will become impotent\\nbecause nerves controlling penile erection are cut during\\nremoval of the bladder. In women,infertility is a conse-\\nquence because the ovaries and uterus are removed.\\nHowever, most women who undergo cystectomy are\\npostmenopausal and past their childbearing years.\\nBoth men and women are fitted with an external bag\\nthat connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag\\nis generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It\\ntakes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the\\nbag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is\\nproduced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be\\ntreated properly to ensure that it does not become infect-\\ned or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their\\nstoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust-\\nment to the major change in life style created by the\\nstoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by\\ndiscussion with their physician.\\nRisks\\nAs with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec-\\ntion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especially\\ndangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of\\nthe membrane lining the abdomen).\\nNormal results\\nThe bladder is successfully removed and a stoma\\ncreated. Intestinal function returns to normal and the\\npatient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or she\\nadjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou-\\ntine of work and recreation, some sports excluded.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe patient develops an infection at the incision site.\\nThe patient does not make a successful psychological\\nadjustment to the long term consequences of impotence\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n983\\nCystectomy'),\n",

Lohr, PhD\\nCystic fibrosis\\nDefinition\\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that\\naffects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, and\\nmale fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis-\\nsue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principal\\norgans affected by the disease.\\nDescription\\nCystic fibrosis affects the body’s ability to move salt\\nand water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungs\\nand pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage-\\nways and preventing proper function.\\nCF affects approximately 30,000 children and young\\nadults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies are\\nborn with CF every year. CF primarily affects people of\\nwhite northern-European descent; rates are much lower\\nin non-white populations.\\nMany of the symptoms of CF can be treated with\\ndrugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to and\\nprompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica-\\ntions have dramatically increased the expected life span\\nof a person with CF. While several decades ago most\\nchildren with CF died by age two, today about half of all\\npeople with CF live past age 31. That median age is\\nexpected to grow as new treatments are developed, and it\\nis estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has a\\nmedian expected life span of 40 years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is\\ncaused by a defect in the person’s genes. Genes, found in\\nthe nucleus of all the body’s cells, control cell function\\nby serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins.\\nProteins carry out a wide variety of functions within\\ncells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is called\\nthe CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans-\\nmembrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in this\\ngene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over\\n500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF.\\nHowever, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR gene\\nhave the same defect, known as delta-F508.\\nMuch as sentences are composed of long strings of\\nwords, each made of letters; genes can be thought of as\\nlong strings of chemical words, each made of chemical\\nletters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can be\\nchanged by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated,\\nor changed, by changes in the sequence of their\\nnucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are called\\npoint mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only at\\none small spot along its length. In other words, the delta-\\nF508 mutation is a loss of one “letter” out of thousands\\nwithin the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR protein\\nmade from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannot\\nperform its function properly.\\nThe CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is\\na complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins that\\ncleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in the\\nbody, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The role\\nof the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit the\\nmucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave these\\ncells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, the\\nCFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thick\\nand sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi-\\nly along the passageways to aid in cleansing.\\nIn CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions\\nout of the mucus-producing cells. With less chloride\\nleaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thick\\nand sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas-\\nsageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas,\\nclogged passageways prevent secretion of digestive\\nenzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairment\\nof digestion—especially of fat—which may lead to mal-\\nnutrition. Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre-\\nventing good air exchange and, ultimately, leading to\\nemphysema. The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients\\nfor bacteria, leading to frequent infections.\\nINHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand\\nthe inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize that\\ngenes actually have two functions. First, as noted above,\\nthey serve as the blueprint for the production of proteins.\\nSecond, they are the material of inheritance: parents pass\\non characteristics to their children by combining the\\ngenes in egg and sperm to make a new individual.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n984\\nCystic fibrosis'),\n",

Dur-\\ning sperm and egg production, however, these two copies\\nseparate, so that each sperm or egg contains only one copy\\nof each gene. When sperm and egg unite, the newly creat-\\ned cell once again has two copies of each gene.\\nThe two gene copies may be the same or they may\\nbe slightly different. For the CFTR gene, for instance, a\\nperson may have two normal copies, or one normal and\\none mutated copy, or two mutated copies. A person with\\ntwo mutated copies will develop cystic fibrosis. A person\\nwith one mutated copy is said to be a carrier. A carrier\\nwill not have symptoms of CF, but can pass on the mutat-\\ned CFTR gene to his/her children.\\nWhen two carriers have children, they have a one in\\nfour chance of having a child with CF each time they\\nconceive. They have a two in four chance of having a\\nchild who is a carrier, and a one in four chance of having\\na child with two normal CFTR genes.\\nApproximately one in every 25 Americans of north-\\nern-European descent is a carrier of the mutated CF\\ngene, while only one in 17,000 African Americans and\\none in 30,000 Asian Americans are carriers. Since carri-\\ners are symptom-free, very few people will know\\nwhether or not they are carriers unless there is a family\\nhistory of the disease. Two white Americans with no\\nfamily history of CF have a one in 2,500 chance of hav-\\ning a child with CF.\\nIt may seem puzzling that a mutated gene with such\\nharmful consequences would remain so common; one\\nmight guess that the high mortality of CF would quickly\\nlead to loss of the mutated gene from the population.\\nSome researchers now believe the reason for the persis-\\ntence of the CF gene is that carriers, those with only one\\ncopy of the gene, are protected from the full effects of\\ncholera, a microorganism that infects the intestine, caus-\\ning intense diarrhea and eventual death by dehydra-\\ntion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is\\nenough to prevent the full effects of cholera infection,\\nwhile not enough to cause the symptoms of CF. This so-\\ncalled “heterozygote advantage” is seen in some other\\ngenetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia.\\nSymptoms\\nThe most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in\\ntwo body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) sys-\\ntem, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs.\\nCF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility.\\nSymptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinal\\nsymptoms often the first to appear.\\nGASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM.

The\\nmeconium of a newborn with meconium ileus is thick-\\nened and sticky, due to the presence of thickened mucus\\nfrom the intestinal glands. Meconium ileus causes\\nabdominal swelling and vomiting, and often requires\\nsurgery immediately after birth. Presence of meconium\\nileus is considered highly indicative of CF. Borderline\\ncases may be misdiagnosed, however, and attributed\\ninstead to “milk allergy.”\\nOther abdominal symptoms are caused by the inabil-\\nity of the pancreas to supply digestive enzymes to the\\nintestine. During normal digestion, as food passes from\\nthe stomach into the small intestine, it is mixed with pan-\\ncreatic secretions which help to break down the nutrients\\nfor absorption. While the intestines themselves also pro-\\nvide some digestive enzymes, the pancreas is the major\\nsource of enzymes for the digestion of all types of foods,\\nespecially fats and proteins.\\nIn CF, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct,\\nwhich is eventually closed off completely by scar tissue\\nformation, leading to a condition known as pancreatic\\ninsufficiency. Without pancreatic enzymes, large\\namounts of undigested food pass into the large intes-\\ntine. Bacterial action on this rich food source can cause\\ngas and abdominal swelling. The large amount of fat\\nremaining in the feces makes it bulky, oily, and foul-\\nsmelling.\\nBecause nutrients are only poorly digested and\\nabsorbed, the person with CF is often ravenously hungry,\\nunderweight, and shorter than expected for his age.\\nWhen CF is not treated for a longer period, a child may\\ndevelop symptoms of malnutrition, including anemia,\\nbloating, and, paradoxically, appetite loss.\\nDiabetes becomes increasingly likely as a person\\nwith CF ages. Scarring of the pancreas slowly destroys\\nthose pancreatic cells which produce insulin, producing\\ntype I, or insulin-dependent diabetes.\\nGall stones affect approximately 10% of adults with\\nCF. Liver problems are less common, but can be caused by\\nthe buildup of fat within the liver. Complications of liver\\nenlargement may include internal hemorrhaging, abdomi-\\nnal fluid (ascites), spleen enlargement, and liver failure.\\nOther gastrointestinal symptoms can include a pro-\\nlapsed rectum, in which part of the rectal lining protrudes\\nthrough the anus; intestinal obstruction; and rarely,\\nintussusception, in which part of the intestinal tube slips\\nover an adjoining part, cutting off blood supply.\\nSomewhat less than 10% of people with CF do not\\nhave gastrointestinal symptoms. Most of these people do\\nnot have the delta-F508 mutation, but rather a different\\none, which presumably allows at least some of their\\nCFTR proteins to function normally in the pancreas.\\nRESPIRATORY TRACT. The respiratory tract includes\\nthe nose, the throat, the trachea (or windpipe), the\\nbronchi (which branch off from the trachea within each\\nlung), the smaller bronchioles, and the blind sacs called\\nalveoli, in which gas exchange takes place between air\\nand blood.\\nSwelling of the sinuses within the nose is common\\nin people with CF. This usually shows up on x-ray, and\\nmay aid the diagnosis of CF. However, this swelling,\\ncalled pansinusitis, rarely causes problems, and does not\\nusually require treatment.\\nNasal polyps , or growths, affect about one in five\\npeople with CF. These growths are not cancerous, and do\\nnot require removal unless they become annoying. While\\nnasal polyps appear in older people without CF, especially\\nthose with allergies, they are rare in children without CF.\\nThe lungs are the site of the most life-threatening\\neffects of CF. The production of a thick, sticky mucus\\nincreases the likelihood of infection, decreases the abil-\\nity to protect against infection, causes inflammation\\nand swelling, decreases the functional capacity of the\\nlungs, and may lead to emphysema. People with CF\\nwill live with chronic populations of bacteria in their\\nlungs, and lung infection is the major cause of death for\\nthose with CF.\\nThe bronchioles and bronchi normally produce a\\nthin, clear mucus that traps foreign particles including\\nbacteria and viruses. Tiny hair-like projections on the\\nsurface of these passageways slowly sweep the mucus\\nalong, out of the lungs and up the trachea to the back of\\nthe throat, where it may be swallowed or coughed up.\\nThis “mucociliary escalator” is one of the principal\\ndefenses against lung infection.\\nThe thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement\\nout of the lungs, and increases the irritation and inflam-\\nmation of lung tissue. This inflammation swells the pas-\\nsageways, partially closing them down, further hamper-\\ning the movement of mucus. A person with CF is likely\\nto cough more frequently and more vigorously as the\\nlungs attempt to clean themselves out.\\nAt the same time, infection becomes more likely\\nsince the mucus is a rich source of nutrients. Bronchitis,\\nbronchiolitis, and pneumonia are frequent in CF. The\\nmost common infecting organisms are the bacteria\\nStaphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae , and\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa . A small percentage of people\\nwith CF have infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia,\\na bacterium which is resistant to most current antibiotics\\n(Burkholderia cepacia was formerly known as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n986\\nCystic fibrosis'),\n",

The fungus Aspergillus fumiga-\\ntus may infect older children and adults.\\nThe body’s response to infection is to increase\\nmucus production; white blood cells fighting the infec-\\ntion thicken the mucus even further as they break down\\nand release their cell contents. These white blood cells\\nalso provoke more inflammation, continuing the down-\\nward spiral that marks untreated CF.\\nAs mucus accumulates, it can plug up the smaller\\npassageways in the lungs, decreasing functional lung\\nvolume. Getting enough air can become difficult; tired-\\nness,shortness of breath , and intolerance of exercise\\nbecome more common. Because air passes obstructions\\nmore easily during inhalation than during exhalation,\\nover time, air becomes trapped in the smallest chambers\\nof the lungs, the alveoli. As millions of alveoli gradually\\nexpand, the chest takes on the enlarged, barrel-shaped\\nappearance typical of emphysema.\\nFor unknown reasons, recurrent respiratory infec-\\ntions lead to “digital clubbing,” in which the last joint of\\nthe fingers and toes becomes slightly enlarged.\\nSWEAT GLANDS. The CFTR protein helps to regulate\\nthe amount of salt in sweat. People with CF have sweat\\nthat is much saltier than normal, and measuring the salti-\\nness of a person’s sweat is the most important diagnostic\\ntest for CF. Parents may notice that their infants taste salty\\nwhen they kiss them. Excess salt loss is not usually a prob-\\nlem except during prolonged exercise or heat. While most\\nolder children and adults with CF compensate for this\\nextra salt loss by eating more salty foods, infants and\\nyoung children are in danger of suffering its effects (such\\nas heat prostration), especially during summer. Heat pros-\\ntration is marked by lethargy, weakness, and loss of\\nappetite, and should be treated as an emergency condition.\\nFERTILITY. Ninety-eight percent of men with CF are\\nsterile, due to complete obstruction or absence of the vas\\ndeferens, the tube carrying sperm out of the testes. While\\nboys and men with CF form normal sperm and have nor-\\nmal levels of sex hormones, sperm are unable to leave the\\ntestes, and fertilization is not possible. Most women with\\nCF are fertile, though they often have more trouble get-\\nting pregnant than women without CF. In both boys and\\ngirls,puberty is often delayed, most likely due to the\\neffects of poor nutrition or chronic lung infection.\\nWomen with good lung health usually have no problems\\nwith pregnancy , while those with ongoing lung infec-\\ntion often do poorly.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe decision to test a child for cystic fibrosis may be\\ntriggered by concerns about recurring gastrointestinal or\\nKEY TERMS\\nCarrier —A person with one copy of a defective\\ngene, who does not have the disease it causes, but\\ncan pass along the defective gene to offspring.\\nCFTR—Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc-\\ntance regulator, the protein responsible for regulat-\\ning chloride movement across cells in some tis-\\nsues.

Some hospitals now require routine\\nscreening of newborns for CF.\\nSweat test\\nThe sweat test is both the easiest and most accurate\\ntest for CF. In this test, a small amount of the drug pilo-\\ncarpine is placed on the skin. A very small electrical cur-\\nrent is then applied to the area, which drives the pilo-\\ncarpine into the skin. The drug stimulates sweating in the\\ntreated area. The sweat is absorbed onto a piece of filter\\npaper, and is then analyzed for its salt content. A person\\nwith CF will have salt concentrations that are one-and-\\none-half to two times greater than normal. The test can\\nbe done on persons of any age, including newborns, and\\nits results can be determined within an hour.

Many couples who already have one child with CF\\ndecide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg-\\nnancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter-\\nminate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are also\\nusually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF,\\nand to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their own\\nfamily planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter-\\nmining his carrier status is often delayed until his teen\\nyears or later, when he is closer to needing the informa-\\ntion to make decisions.\\nNewborn screening\\nSome states now require screening of newborns for\\nCF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood test\\nwhich measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino-\\ngen, which is generally higher in babies with CF than\\nthose without it. This test gives many false positive\\nresults immediately after birth, and so requires a second\\ntest several weeks later. A second positive result is usual-\\nly followed by a sweat test.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for CF. Treatment has advanced con-\\nsiderably in the past several decades, increasing both the\\nlife span and the quality of life for most people affected\\nby CF. Early diagnosis is important to prevent malnutri-\\ntion and infection from weakening the young child. With\\nproper management, many people with CF engage in the\\nfull range of school and sports activities.\\nNutrition\\nPeople with CF usually require high-calorie diets\\nand vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth of\\na person with CF are monitored regularly. Most people\\nwith CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplement\\nor replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas.\\nTablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken with\\nevery meal; depending on the size of the tablet and the\\nmeal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because of\\nincomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, a\\nperson with CF needs to take in about 30% more food\\nthan a person without CF. Low-fat diets are not recom-\\nmended except in special circumstances, since fat is a\\nsource of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories.\\nSome people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri-\\nents from the foods they eat, even with specialized diets\\nand enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option.\\nNutrients can be introduced directly into the stomach\\nthrough a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso-\\ngastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto-\\nmy tube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small\\nintestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can provide\\nnutrition at any time, including at night while the person\\nis sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-quality\\nnutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during the\\nday, allowing normal meals to be taken.\\nRespiratory health\\nThe key to maintaining respiratory health in a person\\nwith CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lung\\nfunction tests are done frequently to track changes in\\nfunctional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputum\\nsamples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteria\\npresent in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken at\\nleast once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas,\\ncan show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula-\\ntion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of a\\nradioactive substance into the bloodstream.\\nPeople with CF live with chronic bacterial coloniza-\\ntion; that is, their lungs are constantly host to several\\nspecies of bacteria. Good general health, especially good\\nnutrition, can keep the immune system healthy, which\\ndecreases the frequency with which these colonies begin\\nan infection, or attack on the lung tissue. Exercise is anoth-\\ner important way to maintain health, and people with CF\\nare encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise.\\nIn addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to\\nprevent infection; and mucus control is an important\\naspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used to\\nallow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For this\\ntechnique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface with\\nhead downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side,\\ndepending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis-\\ntant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. A\\ndevice called a “flutter” offers another way to loosen\\nsecretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube.\\nWhen a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send-\\ning vibrations back through the air in the lungs.

The name means “cystine\\nin the urine.”\\nDescription\\nCystine is an amino acid. Amino acids are organic\\ncompounds needed by the body to make proteins and for\\nmany normal functions. When the kidneys don’t absorb\\ncystine, this compound builds up in the urine. When the\\namount of cystine in the urine exceeds its solubility (the\\ngreatest amount that can be dissolved), crystals form. As\\nthe amount of cystine continues to increase in the urine,\\nthe number of crystals also increases. When very large\\nnumbers of cystine crystals form, they clump together\\ninto what is called a stone.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCystinuria is a rare disease that occurs when people\\ninherit an abnormal gene from their parents. This disease\\noccurs in differing degrees of severity in people who\\nhave inherited either one or two abnormal genes.\\nHumans have two copies of each gene. When both are\\nabnormal, the condition is called homozygous for the\\ndisease. When one copy is normal and the other is abnor-\\nmal, the condition is called heterozygous for the disease.\\nPersons with one abnormal gene can have a milder form\\nof cystinuria that rarely results in the formation of stones.\\nSevere cystinuria occurs when people are homozy-\\ngous for the disease. For these individuals, the kidneys\\nmay excrete as much as 30 times the normal amount of\\ncystine. Research has shown that this condition is caused\\nby mutations on chromosome number two (humans have\\n23 pairs of chromosomes).\\nA person who has inherited cystinuria may have\\nother abnormal bodily functions. In addition to excess\\nlevels of the amino acid cystine, high amounts of the\\namino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are found in\\nthe urine. This condition indicates that these amino acids\\nare not being reabsorbed by the body.\\nWhen excess cystine crystals clump together to form\\na stone, the stone can block portions of the interior of the\\nkidney or the tube (the ureter) that connects the kidney to\\nthe urinary bladder. These cystine stones can be painful,\\nand depending upon where the stone becomes trapped,\\nthe pain can be felt in the lower back or the abdomen.\\nNausea and vomiting can also occur, and patients may\\nsometimes feel the need to urinate often. Cystine stones\\ncan also cause blood in the urine. When the urinary tract\\nis blocked by a stone, urinary tract infections or kidney\\nfailure may result.\\nDiagnosis\\nSmall stones (called “silent”) often do not cause any\\nsymptoms, although they can be detected by an x ray.\\nLarge stones are often painful and easily noticed by the\\npatient. Blood in the urine can also mean that a stone has\\nformed.\\nWhen the urine contains extremely high amounts of\\ncystine, yellow-brown hexagonal crystals are visible\\nwhen a sample is examined under the microscope. Urine\\nsamples can also be mixed with chemicals that change\\ncolor when high levels of cystine are present. When the\\ncompound nitroprusside is added to urine that has been\\nmade alkaline by the addition of ammonia, the urine\\nspecimen turns red if it contains excess cystine.\\nTreatment\\nNo treatment can decrease cystine excretion. The\\nbest treatment for cystinuria is to prevent stones from\\nforming. Stones can be prevented by drinking enough\\nliquid each day (about 5–7 qts) to produce at least 8 pts\\nof urine, thus keeping the concentration of cystine in the\\nurine low. Because a person doesn’t drink throughout the\\nnight, less urine is produced, and the likelihood of stone\\nformation increases. This risk can be minimized by\\ndrinking water or other liquids just before going to bed.\\nDrug treatments\\nIn addition to drinking large amounts of fluids, it is\\nhelpful to make the urine more alkaline.

To increase urine\\nalkalinity, a person may take sodium bicarbonate and\\nacetazolamide. Penicillamine, a drug that increases the\\nsolubility of cystine, may be prescribed for patients who\\ndo not respond well to other therapies. This drug must be\\nused with caution, however, because it can cause serious\\nside effects or allergic reactions. For those unable to take\\npenicillamine, another drug, alpha-mercaptopropionyl-\\nglycine (Thiola), may be prescribed.\\nSurgical treatments\\nMost stones can be removed from the body by nor-\\nmal urination, helped by drinking large amounts of\\nwater. Large stones that cannot be passed this way must\\nbe removed by surgical procedures.\\nLarge stones can be surgically removed by having a\\ndevice called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, up\\nthrough the bladder and into the ureter, where the trapped\\nstone can be seen and removed. Another method involves\\nusing sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body to\\nbreak the large stone into small pieces that can be passed\\nby urination. This external technique is called extracor-\\nporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\\nFor large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per-\\ncutaneous nephrolithomy may be used.

In adult life, the male/female ratio of\\nUTIs is 1:50. After age 50, however, the incidence among\\nmales increases due to prostate disorders.\\nCystitis in women\\nCystitis is a common female problem. It is estimated\\nthat 50% of adult women experience at least one episode\\nof dysuria (painful urination); half of these patients have\\na bacterial UTI. Between 2–5% of women’s visits to pri-\\nmary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% of\\nUTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent.\\nCystitis in men\\nUTIs are uncommon in younger and middle-aged\\nmen, but may occur as complications of bacterial infec-\\ntions of the kidney or prostate gland.\\nCystitis in children\\nIn children, cystitis is often caused by congenital\\nabnormalities (present at birth) of the urinary tract. Vesi-\\ncoureteral reflux is a condition in which the child can-\\nnot completely empty the bladder. It allows urine to\\nremain in or flow backward (reflux) into the partially\\nempty bladder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of cystitis vary according to sex because of\\nthe differences in anatomical structure of the urinary tract.\\nFemales\\nMost bladder infections in women are so-called\\nascending infections, which means that they are caused\\nby disease agents traveling upward through the urethra to\\nthe bladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra\\n(1.2–2 in in length) makes it easy for bacteria to gain\\nentry to the bladder and multiply. The most common bac-\\nteria associated with UTIs in women include Escherichia\\ncoli (about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus,\\nKlebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species. Risk fac-\\ntors for UTIs in women include:\\n• Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if the\\nwoman has multiple partners.\\n• Use of a diaphragm for contraception\\n• An abnormally short urethra\\n• Diabetes or chronic dehydration\\n• The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase)\\nin vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes it\\neasier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs.\\n• Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal matter\\nor vaginal discharges can enter the female urethra\\nbecause its opening is very close to the vagina and anus.\\n• History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with\\ncystitis develop recurrences within two years.\\nThe early symptoms of cystitis in women are\\ndysuria, or pain on urination; urgency, or a sudden\\nstrong desire to urinate; and increased frequency of uri-\\nnation. About 50% of female patients experience fever,\\npain in the lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting ,\\nor shaking chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephri-\\ntis, or spread of the infection to the upper urinary tract.\\nMales\\nMost UTIs in adult males are complications of kid-\\nney or prostate infections. They are usually associated\\nwith a tumor or kidney stones that block the flow of\\nurine and are often persistent infections caused by drug-\\nresistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to be\\ncaused by E. coli or another gram-negative bacterium. S.\\nsaprophyticus, which is the second most common cause\\nof UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. Risk\\nfactors for UTIs in men include:\\n• Lack of circumcision. The foreskin can harbor bacteria\\nthat cause UTIs.\\n• Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of\\ncatheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs.\\nThe symptoms of cystitis and pyelonephritis in men\\nare the same as in women.\\nHemorrhagic cystitis\\nHemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large\\nquantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acute\\nbacterial infection of the bladder. In some cases, hemor-\\nrhagic cystitis is a side effect of radiation therapy or\\ntreatment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitis\\nin children is associated with adenovirus type 11.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen cystitis is suspected, the doctor will first\\nexamine the patient’s abdomen and lower back, to evalu-\\nate unusual enlargements of the kidneys or swelling of\\nthe bladder. In small children, the doctor will check for\\nfever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder.\\nThe next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine\\nsample. The procedure differs somewhat for women and\\nmen. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now be\\nperformed with dipsticks that indicate immune system\\nresponses to infection, as well as with microscopic\\nanalysis of samples.

Loss of sensation due to nerve damage can\\nlead to chronic overfilling.\\nPrecautions\\nThe mild irritation of the urinary tract necessary for\\ninsertion of the catheter may occasionally cause flushing,\\nsweating, and nausea.\\nDescription\\nThe patient begins by emptying the bladder as much\\nas possible. A thin plastic catheter is then slowly inserted\\ninto the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measure-\\nments are taken of the residual urine volume and bladder\\npressure. Pressure measurements may require a rectal\\nprobe to account for the contribution of the abdominal\\nmuscles to the pressure recording.\\nThe bladder is then gradually filled with either warm\\nwater, room temperature water, saline solution, carbon diox-\\nide gas, or a contrast solution for x-ray analysis, depending\\non the type of study being done. The patient is asked to\\ndescribe sensations during filling, including temperature\\nsensations and when the first feeling of bladder fullness\\noccurs. Once the bladder is completely full, the patient is\\nasked to begin voiding, and measurements are again made\\nof pressure and volume, as well as flow rate and pressure.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\\nThe patient may be asked to stop taking certain medica-\\ntions in advance of the test, including sedatives, choliner-\\ngics, and anticholinergics.\\nAftercare\\nCystometry can be somewhat uncomfortable. The\\npatient may wish to reserve an hour or so afterward to\\nrecover. Urinary frequency or urgency, and some redden-\\ning of the urine, may last for a day. Increasing fluid intake\\nhelps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated,\\nor alcoholic beverages are discouraged, because they may\\nirritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such as\\nfever, chills, low back pain , or persistent blood in the\\nurine, should be reported to the examining physician.\\nRisks\\nThere is a slight risk of infection due to tearing of\\nthe urethral lining.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDetrusor—Muscle of the bladder wall.\\nSphincter —Ring of muscle between the bladder\\nand the urethra that functions to close off the ure-\\nthra.\\nUrethra—Tube that empties urine from the blad-\\nder to the exterior of the body.\\nNormal results\\nThe normal bladder should not begin contractions\\nduring filling and should initially expand without resis-\\ntance. A feeling of fullness occurs with a volume of\\n100–200 ml. The adult bladder capacity is 300–500 ml.\\nThe sphincter should relax and open when the patient\\nwills it, accompanied by detrusor contractions. During\\nvoiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and lead\\nto a steady urine stream.\\nAbnormal results\\nInability of the bladder to relax during filling, or low\\nbladder volume, may indicate interstitial cystitis, prostate\\nenlargement, or bladder cancer. Contraction of the blad-\\nder during filling may be due to irritation from infection\\nor cysts, obstruction of the bladder outlet, or neurological\\ndisease such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord\\ninjury. Diminished sensation may occur with nerve\\nlesions, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic overfilling.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLamm D. L., A. S. Paola, and F. A. Paola.

In the female,\\nthis canal lies between the vagina and clitoris; in\\nthe male, the urethra travels through the penis,\\nopening at the tip.\\nPurpose\\nConsequences of a CMV infection can be devastating\\nin a pregnant woman, a transplant patient, or a person\\nwith human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibody\\nscreening helps control the infection risk for these groups.\\nIn a healthy, nonpregnant person, CMV infection is\\nalmost never serious. Symptoms, if present, are mild,\\noften resembling infectious mononucleosis due to\\nEpstein-Barr virus. Antibody screening distinguishes\\nbetween these two infections.\\nDescription\\nWhen first exposed to CMV , a person’s immune sys-\\ntem is triggered and quickly makes antibodies to fight the\\nvirus. Antibodies are special proteins designed to attack\\nand destroy foreign material, in this case, the cytomega-\\nlovirus.\\nThe test combines a person’s serum with a substance\\nto which CMV antibodies attach. This antibody-antigen\\ncomplex is measured and the amount of original anti-\\nbody determined. If positive for antibodies, the serum is\\ndiluted, or titered, and the test repeated until the serum is\\nso dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilu-\\ntion that gives a positive result is the titer reported.\\nA test positive for CMV antibodies means the per-\\nson has been infected with the virus, either currently or\\nin the past; it doesn’t mean the person has lifetime immu-\\nnity. After an infection, this virus, like all members of the\\nherpes virus group, can stay hidden inside a person and\\ncause infection if the person’s immune system later\\nweakens and antibody protection decreases. In fact, reac-\\ntivation of such hidden (or latent) infection is not at all\\nuncommon and usually occurs without symptoms.\\nTransplant patients and people with weakened\\nimmune systems, including those with HIV , are vulnera-\\nble to infection from several routes, including from\\nanother person, from a donated organ or transfused\\nblood, or from reactivation of a past infection. Before\\ntransplant, both the recipient and donor are usually tested\\nfor antibodies. A recipient who has never had CMV (neg-\\native for antibodies), should not receive an organ from a\\ndonor who has had CMV (positive for antibodies). CVM\\ninfection can be associated with organ rejection, or can\\ncause illness such as pneumonia , hepatitis, or death.\\nSimilarly, blood is usually screened for CMV antibodies\\nbefore being transfused into a person with a weakened\\nimmune system.\\nCMV infection is the most common congenital\\ninfection (existing at birth).

Babies can be born infected with CMV , either\\nbecoming infected in the uterus (congenital infection) or\\nduring birth (from infected cervical secretions).\\nLike other herpes viruses, CMV remains inactive\\n(dormant) within the body for life after the initial infec-\\ntion. Some of the more serious types of CMV infections\\noccur in people who have been harboring the dormant\\nvirus, only to have it reactivate when their immune sys-\\ntem is stressed. Immune systems may be weakened\\nbecause of cancer chemotherapy , medications given\\nafter organ transplantation, or diseases that significantly\\nlower immune resistance like acquired immunodeficien-\\ncy syndrome (AIDS).\\nIn a healthy person, initial CMV infection often\\noccurs without symptoms and is rarely noticed. Occa-\\nsionally, a first-time infection with CMV may cause a\\nmild illness called mononucleosis. Symptoms include\\nswollen glands, liver, and spleen; fever; increased white\\nblood cells; headache; fatigue; and sore throat. About\\n8% of all mononucleosis cases are due to CMV infec-\\ntion. A similar infection, though slightly more serious,\\nmay occur two to four weeks after receiving a blood\\ntransfusioncontaining CMV .\\nIn people with weakened immune systems, CMV\\ninfection can cause more serious and potentially life-\\nthreatening illnesses. These illnesses include pneumo-\\nnia, and inflammations of the liver (hepatitis), brain\\n(encephalitis ), esophagus (esophagitis), large intestine\\n(colitis), and retina of the eye (retinitis).\\nBabies who contract CMV from their mothers dur-\\ning birth rarely develop any illness from these infections.\\nInfants born prematurely who become CMV infected\\nduring birth have a greater chance of complications,\\nincluding pneumonia, hepatitis, and decreased blood\\nplatelets.\\nHowever, an unborn baby is at great risk for seri-\\nous problems when the mother becomes infected with\\nCMV for the first time while pregnant. About 10% of\\nthese babies will be born with obvious problems,\\nincluding prematurity , lung problems, an enlarged\\nliver and spleen, jaundice , anemia, low birth weight,\\nsmall head size, and inflammation of the retina. About\\n90% of these babies may appear perfectly normal at\\nbirth. Unfortunately, about 20% of these babies will\\nlater develop severe hearing impairments and mental\\nretardation .\\nDiagnosis\\nBody fluids or tissues can be tested to reveal CMV\\ninfection. However, this information is not always partic-\\nularly helpful because CMV stays dormant in the cells\\nfor life. Tests to look for special immune cells (antibod-\\nies) directed specifically against CMV are useful in prov-\\ning that a person has been infected with CMV . However,\\nthese tests do not give any information regarding when\\nthe CMV infection first occurred.\\nTreatment\\nGanciclovir and foscarnet are both antiviral med-\\nications that have been used to treat patients with\\nweak immune systems who develop a serious illness\\nfrom CMV (including retinitis). As of 1998, research\\nis still being done to try to find useful drugs to treat\\nnewborn babies suffering from congenital infection\\nwith CMV . Antiviral drugs are not used to treat\\nCMV infection in otherwise healthy patients because\\nthe drugs have significant side effects that outweigh\\ntheir benefits.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis in healthy people with CMV infection\\nis excellent. About 0.1% of all newborn babies will\\nhave serious damage from CMV infection occurring\\nwhile they were developing in the uterus. About 50%\\nof all transplant patients will develop severe illnesses\\ndue to reactivation of dormant CMV infection.

From there, the tears travel\\nthrough little tube-like structures (canaliculi) to the\\nlacrimal sac. The nasolacrimal ducts then take the tears\\nfrom the lacrimal sac to the nose. That’s why people\\nneed to blow their nose when they cry a lot.\\nDacryocystitis is usually caused by a blockage of\\nthe nasolacrimal duct, which allows fluid to drain into\\nthe nasal passages. When the lacrimal sac does not\\ndrain, bacteria can grow in the trapped fluid. This con-\\ndition is most common in infants and people over 40\\nyears old.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn newborn infants, the nasolacrimal duct may fail to\\nform an opening—a condition called dacryostenosis. The\\ncause of dacryocystitis in adults is usually associated\\nwith inflammation and infection in the nasal region.\\nDacryocystitis can be acute, having a sudden onset, or it\\ncan be chronic, with symptoms occurring over the course\\nof weeks or months. Symptoms of acute dacryocystitis\\ncan include pain, redness, tearing, and swelling at the\\ninner corner of the eye by the nose. In chronic dacryocys-\\ntitis, the eye area may be swollen, watery or teary, and,\\nwhen pressure is applied to the area, there may be a dis-\\ncharge of pus or mucus through the punctum.\\nDiagnosis\\nDacryocystitis usually occurs in only one eye. As\\nmentioned, the symptoms can range from watery eyes,\\npain, swelling, and redness to a discharge of pus when\\npressure is applied to the area between the bridge of the\\nnose and the inner eyelids. A sample of the pus may be\\ncollected on a swab or in a tube for laboratory analysis.\\nThe type of antibiotic and treatment may depend on\\nwhich bacteria is present. In the acute form, a blood test\\nmay reveal an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count;\\nwith a chronic infection, the WBC count is usually nor-\\nmal.

Dur-\\ning World War II she spent weekends at the Kantonspital\\n(Cantonai Hospital) in Zürich, where she volunteered to\\nassist escaped refugees. After the war she visited Maj-\\ndanek concentration camp, where the horrors of the\\ndeath chambers stimulated in her a desire to help peo-\\nple facing death and to understand the human impulses\\nof love and destruction. She extended her medical\\nbackground by becoming a practicing psychiatrist. Her\\nformal work with dying patients began in 1965 when\\nshe was a faculty member at the University of Chicago.\\nShe also conducted research on basic questions con-\\ncerning life after death at the Manhattan State Hospital,\\nNew York. Her studies of death and dying have involved\\naccounts by patients who reported out-of-the-body trav-\\nel.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nDebridement\\nDefinition\\nDebridement is the process of removing non-living\\ntissue from pressure ulcers, burns, and other wounds.\\nPurpose\\nDebridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,\\nburns, and other wounds. Wounds that contain non-living\\n(necrotic) tissue take longer to heal. The necrotic tissue\\nmay become colonized with bacteria, producing an\\nunpleasant odor. Though the wound is not necessarily\\ninfected, the bacteria can cause inflammation and strain\\nthe body’s ability to fight infection. Necrotic tissue may\\nalso hide pockets of pus called abscesses. Abscesses can\\ndevelop into a general infection that may lead to ampu-\\ntation or death.\\nPrecautions\\nNot all wounds need debridement. Sometimes it is\\nbetter to leave a hardened crust of dead tissue, called an\\neschar, than to remove it and create an open wound, partic-\\nularly if the crust is stable and the wound is not inflamed.\\nBefore performing debridement, the physician will take a\\nmedical history with attention to factors that might com-\\nplicate healing, such as medications being taken and\\nsmoking. The physician will also note the cause of the\\nwound and the ways it has been treated. Some ulcers and\\nother wounds occur in places where blood flow is\\nimpaired, for example, the foot ulcers that can accompany\\ndiabetes mellitus. In such cases, the physician or nurse\\nmay decide not to debride the wound because blood flow\\nmay be insufficient for proper healing.\\nDescription\\nIn debridement, dead tissue is removed so that the\\nremaining living tissue can adequately heal. Dead tissue\\nexposed to the air will form a hard black crust, called an\\neschar. Deeper tissue will remain moist and may appear\\nwhite, or yellow and soft, or flimsy. The four major\\ndebridement techniques are surgical, mechanical, chemi-\\ncal, and autolytic.\\nSurgical debridement\\nSurgical debridement (also known as sharp debride-\\nment) uses a scalpel, scissors, or other instrument to cut\\ndead tissue from a wound. It is the quickest and most\\nefficient method of debridement. It is the preferred\\nmethod if there is rapidly developing inflammation of the\\nbody’s connective tissues (cellulitis) or a more general-\\nized infection ( sepsis) that has entered the bloodstream.\\nThe procedure can be performed at a patient’s bedside. If\\nthe target tissue is deep or close to another organ, howev-\\ner, or if the patient is experiencing extreme pain, the pro-\\ncedure may be done in an operating room. Surgical\\ndebridement is generally performed by a physician, but\\nin some areas of the country an advance practice nurse or\\nphysician assistant may perform the procedure.\\nThe physician will begin by flushing the area with a\\nsaline (salt water) solution, and then will apply a topical\\nanesthetic gel to the edges of the wound to minimize\\npain. Using a forceps to grip the dead tissue, the physi-\\ncian will cut it away bit by bit with a scalpel or scissors.\\nSometimes it is necessary to leave some dead tissue\\nbehind rather than disturb living tissue. The physician\\nmay repeat the process again at another session.\\nMechanical debridement\\nIn mechanical debridement, a saline-moistened\\ndressing is allowed to dry overnight and adhere to the\\ndead tissue. When the dressing is removed, the dead tis-\\nsue is pulled away too. This process is one of the oldest\\nmethods of debridement. It can be very painful because\\nthe dressing can adhere to living as well as nonliving tis-\\nsue. Because mechanical debridement cannot select\\nbetween good and bad tissue, it is an unacceptable\\ndebridement method for clean wounds where a new layer\\nof healing cells is already developing.\\nChemical debridement\\nChemical debridement makes use of certain enzymes\\nand other compounds to dissolve necrotic tissue.

In fact, the body\\nmakes its own enzyme, collagenase, to break down colla-\\ngen, one of the major building blocks of skin. A pharma-\\nceutical version of collagenase is available and is highly\\neffective as a debridement agent. As with other debride-\\nment techniques, the area first is flushed with saline. Any\\ncrust of dead tissue is etched in a cross-hatched pattern to\\nallow the enzyme to penetrate. A topical antibiotic is also\\napplied to prevent introducing infection into the blood-\\nstream. A moist dressing is then placed over the wound.\\nAutolytic debridement\\nAutolytic debridement takes advantage of the body’s\\nown ability to dissolve dead tissue. The key to the tech-\\nnique is keeping the wound moist, which can be accom-\\nplished with a variety of dressings. These dressings help\\nto trap wound fluid that contains growth factors, enzymes,\\nand immune cells that promote wound healing. Autolytic\\ndebridement is more selective than any other debridement\\nmethod, but it also takes the longest to work. It is inappro-\\npriate for wounds that have become infected.\\nPreparation\\nThe physician or nurse will begin by assessing the\\nneed for debridement. The wound will be examined, fre-\\nquently by inserting a gloved finger into the wound to\\nestimate the depth of dead tissue and evaluate whether it\\nlies close to other organs, bone, or important body fea-\\ntures. The area may be flushed with a saline solution\\nbefore debridement begins, and a topical anesthetic gel\\nor injection may be applied if surgical or mechanical\\ndebridement is being performed.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgical debridement, the wound will be\\npacked with a dry dressing for a day to control bleeding.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEschar—A hardened black crust of dead tissue\\nthat may form over a wound.\\nPressure ulcer—Also known as a decubitus ulcer,\\npressure ulcers are open wounds that form when-\\never prolonged pressure is applied to skin covering\\nbony outcrops of the body.

Moist dressings are also used after mechanical,\\nchemical, and autolytic debridement. Many factors con-\\ntribute to wound healing, which frequently can take con-\\nsiderable time. Debridement may need to be repeated.\\nRisks\\nIt is possible that underlying tendons, blood vessels\\nor other structures will be damaged during the examina-\\ntion of the wound and during surgical debridement.

A study of the\\nUnited States military community in Okinawa, where tens\\nof thousands of sport and military dives are made each\\nyear, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989–95,\\nincluding nine deaths. This translated into estimates of one\\ncase in every 7,400 dives and one death in every 76,900\\ndives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, and\\nmany cases certainly go unnoticed by divers.\\nAt times the terminology adopted by writers on\\nDCS can be confusing. Some substitute the term\\ndecompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCI\\nas a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An older\\nterm for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine-\\nteenth century when it was discovered that bridge con-\\nstruction crews working at the bottom of lakes and\\nrivers in large pressurized enclosures (caissons) were\\nexperiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on\\nreturning to the surface.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe air we breathe is mostly a mixture of two gases,\\nnitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Unlike oxygen, nitro-\\ngen is a biologically inert gas, meaning that it is not\\nmetabolized (converted into other substances) by the\\nbody. For this reason, most of the nitrogen we inhale is\\nexpelled when we exhale, but some is dissolved into the\\nblood and other tissues. During a dive, however, the\\nlungs take in more nitrogen than usual. This happens\\nbecause the surrounding water pressure is greater than\\nthe air pressure at sea level (twice as great at 33 ft [10 m],\\nfor instance). As the water pressure increases, so does the\\npressure of the nitrogen in the compressed air inhaled by\\nthe diver. Because increased pressure causes an increase\\nin gas density, the diver takes in more nitrogen with each\\nbreath than he or she would at sea level. Instead of being\\nexhaled, however, the extra nitrogen safely dissolves into\\nthe tissues, where it remains until the diver begins his or\\nher return to the surface (under some circumstances the\\nextra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis, but that con-\\ndition is distinct from DCS). On the way up, decompres-\\nsion occurs (in other words, the water pressure drops),\\nand with the change in pressure, the extra nitrogen grad-\\nually diffuses out of the tissues and is delivered by the\\nbloodstream to the lungs, which expel it from the body. If\\nthe diver surfaces too quickly, however, potentially dan-\\ngerous nitrogen bubbles can form in the tissues and cause\\nDCS. These bubbles can compress nerves, obstruct arter-\\nies, veins, and lymphatic vessels, and trigger harmful\\nchemical reactions in the blood. The precise reasons for\\nbubble formation remain unclear.\\nHow much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies\\nwith the dive’s depth and duration. Dive tables prepared\\nby the U.S. Navy and other organizations specify how\\nlong most divers can safely remain at a particular depth.\\nIf the dive table limits are exceeded, the diver must pause\\non the way up to allow the nitrogen to diffuse into the\\nbloodstream without forming bubbles; these pauses are\\ncalled decompression stops, and are carefully calibrated.\\nDCS can occur, however, even when a diver obeys safe\\ndiving rules. In such cases, the predisposing factors\\ninclude fatigue , obesity , dehydration , hypothermia ,\\nand recent alcohol use. As well, people who fly or travel\\nto high-altitude locations without letting 12–24 hours\\npass after their last dive are at risk for DCS as well\\nbecause their bodies undergo further decompression.\\nThis is true even when flying in commercial aircraft.\\nMany travelers are unaware that to save money on fuel\\nthe cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is set much\\nlower than the pressure at sea level. At 30,000 ft (9,144\\nm), for instance, cabin pressure is usually equivalent to\\nthe pressure at 7,000–8,000 ft (2,133–2,438 m) above sea\\nlevel, a safe setting for everyone but recent divers. Exact-\\nly how long a diver should wait before flying or traveling\\nto a high-altitude location depends on how much diving\\nhe or she has done and other considerations.

Symptoms can appear minutes after a diver sur-\\nfaces, and in about 80% of cases do so within eight\\nhours. Pain is often the only symptom; this is sometimes\\ncalled the bends, although many people incorrectly use\\nthat term as a synonym for DCS itself. The pain, which\\nranges from mild to severe, is usually limited to the\\njoints, but can be felt anywhere. Severe itching (pruritis),\\nskin rashes, and skin mottling (cutis marmorata) are\\nother possible symptoms. All of these are sometimes\\nclassified as manifestations of type 1 or “mild” DCS.\\ntype 2 or “serious” DCS can lead, among other things, to\\nparalysis, brain damage, heart attacks, and death. Many\\nDCS victims, however, experience both type 1 and type 2\\nsymptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis requires taking a medical history (ques-\\ntioning the patient about his or her health and recent\\nactivities) and conducting a physical examination.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1009\\nDecompression sickness'),\n",

This congestion results when mem-\\nbranes lining the nose become swollen. Decongestants\\nrelieve the swelling by narrowing the blood vessels that\\nsupply the nose. This reduces the blood supply to the\\nswollen membranes, causing the membranes to shrink.\\nThese medicines do not cure colds or reverse the\\neffects of histamines—chemicals released as part of the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21010\\nDecongestants'),\n",

They will not relieve all of the symptoms\\nassociated with colds and allergies, only the stuffiness.\\nWhen considering whether to use a decongestant for\\ncold symptoms, keep in mind that most colds go away\\nwith or without treatment and that taking medicine is not\\nthe only way to relieve a stuffy nose. Drinking hot tea or\\nbroth or eating chicken soup may help. There are also\\nadhesive strips can be placed on the nose to help widen\\nthe nasal passages, making breathing through the nasal\\npassages a bit easier when congestion is present.\\nPrecautions\\nDecongestant nasal sprays and nose drops may\\ncause a problem called rebound congestion if used\\nrepeatedly over several days. When this happens, the\\nnose remains stuffy or gets worse with every dose. The\\nonly way to stop the cycle is to stop using the drug. The\\nstuffiness should then go away within about a week.\\nAnyone who shows signs of severe rebound congestion\\nshould also contact his or her physician.\\nDo not use decongestant nasal sprays for more than\\nthree days. Decongestants taken by mouth should not be\\nused for more than seven days. If the congestion has not\\ngone away in this time, or if the symptoms are accompa-\\nnied by fever, call a physician.\\nDo not use a decongestant nasal spray after the prod-\\nuct’s expiration date. If the product has become cloudy\\nor discolored, throw it away and do not use it. Do not\\nshare droppers or spray bottles with anyone else, as this\\ncould spread infection. Do not let droppers and bottle\\ntips touch countertops or other surfaces.\\nSome decongestants cause drowsiness. People who\\ntakes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do\\nanything else that might be dangerous until they have\\nfound out how the drugs affect them.\\nIn general, older people may be more sensitive to the\\neffects of decongestants and may need to take lower\\ndoses to avoid side effects. People in this age group\\nshould not take long-acting (extended release) forms of\\ndecongestants unless they have previously taken a short-\\nacting form with no ill effects.\\nChildren may also be more sensitive to the effects of\\ndecongestants. Before giving any decongestant to a\\nchild, check the package label carefully. Some of these\\nmedicines are too strong for use in children. Serious side\\neffects are possible if they are given large amounts of\\nthese drugs or if they swallow nose drops, nasal spray or\\neye drops. If this happens, call a physician or poison cen-\\nter immediately.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if they\\ntake decongestants. Before taking these drugs, be sure to\\nlet the physician know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto decongestants in the past should let his or her physi-\\ncian know before these drugs or any similar drugs are\\nprescribed. The physician should also be told about any\\nallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-\\nstances.\\nPREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, some\\ndecongestants have had unwanted effects on fetuses.\\nHowever, it is not known whether such effects also occur\\nin people. Women who are pregnant or who plan to\\nbecome pregnant should check with their physicians\\nbefore taking decongestants.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some decongestants pass into\\nbreast milk and may have unwanted effects on nursing\\nbabies whose mothers take the drugs. Women who are\\nbreastfeeding should check with their physicians before\\nusing decongestants. If they need to take the medicine, it\\nmay be necessary to bottle feed the baby with formula\\nwhile taking it.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Anyone with heart\\nor blood vessel disease, high blood pressure, diabetes,\\nenlarged prostate, or overactive thyroid should not take\\ndecongestants unless under a physician’s supervision.\\nThe medicine can increase blood sugar in people with\\ndiabetes. It can be especially dangerous in people with\\nhigh blood pressure, as it may increase blood pressure.\\nBefore using decongestants, people with any of\\nthese medical problems should make sure their physi-\\ncians are aware of their conditions:\\n• glaucoma\\n• history of mental illness\\nDecongestants may have a variety of side effects,\\nand may also interact with other medications the patient\\nis taking.\\nSide effects\\nDECONGESTANT NASAL SPRAYS AND NOSE DROPS.\\nThe most common side effects from decongestant nasal\\nsprays and nose drops are sneezing and temporary burn-\\ning, stinging, or dryness. These effects are usually tem-\\nporary and do not need medical attention.

An estimated 600,000 of these develop pul-\\nmonary embolism , a potentially fatal complication\\nwhere the blood clots break off and form pulmonary\\nemboli, plugs that block the lung arteries. Sixty thousand\\npeople die of pulmonary embolism each year. Deep vein\\nthrombosis is also called venous thromboembolism,\\nthrombophlebitisor phlebothrombosis.\\nDeep vein thrombosis is a major complication in\\npatients who have had orthopedic surgery or pelvic,\\nabdominal, or thoracic surgery . Patients with cancer\\nand other chronic illnesses (including congestive heart\\nfailure), as well as those who have suffered a recent\\nmyocardial infarction, are also at high risk for develop-\\ning DVT. Deep vein thrombosis can be chronic, with\\nrecurrent episodes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDeep vein thrombosis is caused by blood clots in\\nblood vessels that form in veins where blood flow is\\nsluggish or has been disturbed, in pockets in the calf’s\\ndeep veins, or in veins that have been traumatized.\\nSymptoms include swelling and tenderness of the calf or\\nthigh, and possibly warmth. Only 23–50% of patients\\nexperience symptoms, so it’s often “silent.” Some indi-\\nviduals and families have underlying clotting tendencies\\nthat can be tested for.\\nDiagnosis\\nDeep vein thrombosis can be detected through\\nvenography and radionuclide venography, Doppler\\nultrasonography , and impedance plethysmography.\\nVenography is the most accurate test, but it is not used\\nmuch, because it is often painful, expensive, exposes\\nthe patient to radiation, and can cause reactions and\\ncomplications. Venography identifies the location,\\nextent, and degree of attachment of the blood clots, and\\nenables the condition of the deep leg veins to be\\nassessed. A contrast solution is injected into a foot vein\\nthrough a catheter. The physician observes the move-\\nment of the solution through the vein with a fluoro-\\nscope while a series of x rays are taken. Venography\\ntakes 30–45 minutes and can be done in a physician’s\\noffice, a laboratory, or a hospital.

It should be performed immediately after\\nidentifying that the patient is experiencing a cardiac\\nemergency, has no pulse, and is unresponsive.\\nPrecautions\\nDefibrillation should not be performed on a patient\\nwho has a pulse or is alert, as this could cause a lethal\\nheart rhythm disturbance or cardiac arrest. The paddles\\nused in the procedure should not be placed on a woman’s\\nbreasts or over a pacemaker.\\nDescription\\nFibrillations cause the heart to stop pumping blood,\\nleading to brain damage and/or cardiac arrest. About\\n10% of the ability to restart the heart is lost with every\\nminute that the heart stays in fibrillation. Death can\\noccur in minutes unless the normal heart rhythm is\\nrestored through defibrillation. Because immediate\\ndefibrillation is crucial to the patient’s survival, the\\nAmerican Heart Association has called for the integra-\\ntion of defibrillation into an effective emergency cardiac\\ncare system. The system should include early access,\\nearly cardiopulmonary resuscitation , early defibrilla-\\ntion, and early advanced cardiac care.\\nDefibrillators deliver a brief electric shock to the\\nheart, which enables the heart’s natural pacemaker to\\nregain control and establish a normal heart rhythm. The\\ndefibrillator is an electronic device with electrocardio-\\ngram leads and paddles. During defibrillation, the pad-\\ndles are placed on the patient’s chest, caregivers stand\\nback, and the electric shock is delivered. The patient’s\\npulse and heart rhythm are continually monitored. Med-\\nications to treat possible causes of the abnormal heart\\nrhythm may be administered. Defibrillation continues\\nuntil the patient’s condition stabilizes or the procedure is\\nordered to be discontinued.\\nEarly defibrillators, about the size and weight of a\\ncar battery, were used primarily in ambulances and hos-\\npitals. The American Heart Association now advocates\\npublic access defibrillation; this calls for placing auto-\\nmated external defibrillators (AEDS) in police vehicles,\\nairplanes, and at public events, etc. The AEDS are small-\\ner, lighter, less expensive, and easier to use than the early\\ndefibrillators. They are computerized to provide simple,\\nverbal instructions to the operator and to make it impos-\\nsible to deliver a shock to a patient whose heart is not fib-\\nrillating. The placement of AEDs is likely to expand to\\nmany public locations.\\nPreparation\\nAfter help is called for, cardiopulmonary resuscita-\\ntion (CPR) is begun and continued until the caregivers\\narrive and set up the defibrillator.

This condition can result from illness; a\\nhot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high tem-\\nperatures; not drinking enough water; and overuse of\\ndiureticsor other medications that increase urination.\\nDehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balance\\nneeded to maintain healthy cells and tissues.\\nWater accounts for about 60% of a man’s body\\nweight. It represents about 50% of a woman’s weight.\\nYoung and middle-aged adults who drink when they’re\\nthirsty do not generally have to do anything more to\\nmaintain their body’s fluid balance. Children need more\\nwater because they expend more energy, but most chil-\\ndren who drink when they are thirsty get as much water\\nas their systems require.\\nAge and dehydration\\nAdults over the age of 60 who drink only when they\\nare thirsty probably get only about 90% of the fluid they\\nneed. Developing a habit of drinking only in response to\\nthe body’s thirst signals raises an older person’s risk of\\nbecoming dehydrated. Seniors who have relocated to\\nareas where the weather is warmer or dryer than the cli-\\nmate they are accustomed to are even likelier to become\\ndehydrated unless they make it a practice to drink even\\nwhen they are not thirsty.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21016\\nDehydration'),\n",

This condition generally occurs in chil-\\ndren who have stomach flu characterized by vomiting\\nand diarrhea , or who can not or will not take enough\\nfluids to compensate for excessive losses associated with\\nfeverand sweating of acute illness. An infant can\\nbecome dehydrated only hours after becoming ill. Dehy-\\ndration is a major cause of infant illness and death\\nthroughout the world.\\nTypes of dehydration\\nMild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5% of\\nthe body’s fluid. Loss of 5–10% is considered moderate\\ndehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of 10–15% of\\nbody fluids) is a life-threatening condition that requires\\nimmediate medical care.\\nComplications of dehydration\\nWhen the body’s fluid supply is severely depleted,\\nhypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition,\\nwhich is also called physical collapse, is characterized by\\npale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallow\\nbreathing.\\nBlood pressure sometimes drops so low it can not be\\nmeasured, and skin at the knees and elbows may become\\nblotchy. Anxiety, restlessness, and thirst increase. After\\nthe patient’s temperature reaches 107°F (41.7°C) damage\\nto the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nStrenuous activity, excessive sweating, high fever,\\nand prolonged vomiting or diarrhea are common causes\\nof dehydration. So are staying in the sun too long, not\\ndrinking enough fluids, and visiting or moving to a warm\\nregion where it doesn’t often rain. Alcohol,caffeine, and\\ndiuretics or other medications that increase the amount of\\nfluid excreted can cause dehydration.\\nReduced fluid intake can be a result of:\\n• appetite loss associated with acute illness\\n• excessive urination (polyuria)\\n• nausea\\n• bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the phar-\\nynx (pharyngitis)\\n• inflammation of the mouth caused by illness, infection,\\nirritation, or vitamin deficiency (stomatitis)\\nOther conditions that can lead to dehydration include:\\n• disease of the adrenal glands, which regulate the body’s\\nwater and salt balance and the function of many organ\\nsystems\\n• diabetes mellitus\\n• eating disorders\\n• kidney disease\\n• chronic lung disease\\nAn infant who does not wet a diaper in an eight-\\nhour period is dehydrated. The soft spot on the baby’s\\nhead (fontanel) may be depressed. Symptoms of dehy-\\ndration at any age include cracked lips, dry or sticky\\nmouth, lethargy, and sunken eyes. A person who is\\ndehydrated cries without shedding tears and does not\\nurinate very often. The skin is less elastic than it should\\nbe and is slow to return to its normal position after\\nbeing pinched.\\nDehydration can cause confusion, constipation, dis-\\ncomfort, drowsiness, fever, and thirst. The skin turns pale\\nand cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth and\\nnose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimes\\nraces and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid loss\\ncan cause serious neurological problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe patient’s symptoms and medical history usual-\\nly suggest dehydration. Physical examination may\\nreveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pres-\\nsure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to check\\nelectrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g., urine specific\\ngravity and creatinine), are used to evaluate the severi-\\nty of the problem. Other laboratory tests may be\\nordered to determine the underlying condition (such as\\ndiabetes or an adrenal gland disorder) causing the\\ndehydration.\\nTreatment\\nIncreased fluid intake and replacement of lost elec-\\ntrolytes are usually sufficient to restore fluid balances in\\npatients who are mildly or moderately dehydrated.

A\\ndoctor should be notified whenever an infant or child\\nexhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concerned\\nthat a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead to\\ndehydration.\\nA doctor should also be notified if:\\n• a child less than three months old develops a fever\\nhigher than 100°F (37.8°C)\\n• a child more than three months old develops a fever\\nhigher than 102°F (38.9°C)\\n• symptoms of dehydration worsen\\n• an individual urinates very sparingly or does not urinate\\nat all during a six-hour period\\n• dizziness, listlessness, or excessive thirst occur\\n• a person who is dieting and using diuretics loses more\\nthan 3 lb (1.3 kg) in a day or more than 5 lb (2.3 kg) a\\nweek\\nWhen treating dehydration, the underlying cause\\nmust also be addressed. For example, if dehydration is\\ncaused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre-\\nscribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who are\\ndehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal\\ngland disorders must receive treatment for these condi-\\ntions as well as for the resulting dehydration.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGelatin water can be substituted for electrolyte-\\nreplacement solutions. It is made by diluting a 3-oz\\npackage in a quart of water or by adding one-quarter\\nteaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar to a pint of\\nwater.\\nPrognosis\\nMild dehydration rarely results in complications. If\\nthe cause is eliminated and lost fluid is replaced, mild\\ndehydration can usually be cured in 24–48 hours.\\nV omiting and diarrhea that continue for several days\\nwithout adequate fluid replacement can be fatal. The risk\\nof life-threatening complications is greater for young\\nchildren and the elderly. However, dehydration that is\\nrapidly recognized and treated has a good outcome.\\nPrevention\\nPatients who are vomiting or who have diarrhea\\ncan prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluid for\\ntheir urine to remain the color of pale straw. Ensuring\\nthat patients always drink adequate fluids during an ill-\\nness will help prevent dehydration. Infants and young\\nchildren with diarrhea and vomiting can be given elec-\\ntrolyte solutions such as Pedialyte to help prevent dehy-\\ndration. People who are not ill can maintain proper\\nfluid balance by drinking several glasses of water\\nbefore going outside on a hot day. It is also a good idea\\nto avoid coffee and tea, which increase body tempera-\\nture and water loss.\\nPatients should know whether any medication they\\nare taking can cause dehydration and should get prompt\\nmedical care to correct any underlying condition that\\nincreases the risk of dehydration.\\nOther methods of preventing dehydration and ensur-\\ning adequate fluid intake include:\\n• eating more soup at mealtime\\n• drinking plenty of water and juice at mealtime and\\nbetween meals\\n• keeping a glass of water nearby when working or relax-\\ning\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1018\\nDehydration'),\n",

After initial expo-\\nsure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys-\\ntem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both\\nthese immune agents respond when the body is reex-\\nposed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating\\nproteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed\\nan immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells’ respons-\\nes occur over several days, and are thus called delayed\\nhypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat-\\ned by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red-\\nness (erythema) at the injection site.\\nA DHT is performed for one of three reasons:\\n• To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber-\\nculosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting\\ninto the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con-\\ntains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke\\nan immune response.\\n• To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants,\\nsuch as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done\\nby placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con-\\ntaining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub-\\nstances.\\n• To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of\\nthe evaluation of immune system health in infection,\\ncancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen-\\ning, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict\\nsurvival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu-\\nate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used\\nfor these tests must be ones the patient has been\\nexposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated\\nantigens from common infectious agents to which the\\npatient might have been exposed, such as mumps ,\\nCandida albicans , tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a\\nskin fungus).\\nPrecautions\\nNo special precautions are necessary for most\\npatients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain\\nskin irritants should alert the clinician performing the\\ntest. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens\\ncontain mercury, a source of irritation to some\\npatients.\\nDescription\\nThe most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in\\nwhich a small amount of TB antigen is injected into\\nthe skin. The area is examined 48–72 hours after the\\ninjection.\\nIn the patch test, 20–30 adhesive patches are usually\\nplaced on the upper back. The patches are kept in place\\nand the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are\\nthen removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after-\\nward, and possibly again a day or more following that.\\nPatch testing is usually performed following a patient\\ncomplaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance.\\nTesting may suggest several candidates; identifying the\\nright one requires careful review of the patient’s possi-\\nble exposure.\\nThe test of overall T cell responsiveness is per-\\nformed with several injections. Each area injected is cir-\\ncled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the\\ninjection.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparation is necessary.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1019\\nDelayed hypersensitivity skin test'),\n",

The loss of cognitive abilities that\\noccurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory,\\nreasoning, planning, and personality. While the over-\\nwhelming number of people with dementia are elderly, it\\nis not an inevitable part of aging. Instead, dementia is\\ncaused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease\\n(AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular or\\nmulti-infarct dementia.\\nThe prevalence of dementia has been difficult to\\ndetermine, partly because of differences in definition\\namong different studies, and partly because there is some\\nnormal decline in functional ability with age. Dementia\\naffects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, and\\nup to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates for\\ndementia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%.\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD; that\\nnumber is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by\\nthe middle of the twenty-first century as the population\\nas a whole ages.\\nThe cost of dementia can be considerable. While\\nmost people with dementia are retired and do not suffer\\nincome losses from their disease, the cost of care is often\\nenormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-\\nily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and home\\nmodifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care may\\ncost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-\\nchological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can be\\neven more profound. The person with dementia loses\\ncontrol of many of the essential features of his life and\\npersonality, and loved ones lose a family member even as\\nthey continue to cope with the burdens of increasing\\ndependence and unpredictability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nDementia is usually caused by degeneration in the\\ncerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for\\nthoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death of\\nbrain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair-\\nment which characterizes dementia.\\nThe most common cause of dementia is AD,\\naccounting for half to three quarters of all cases. The\\nbrain of a person with AD becomes clogged with two\\nabnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and\\nsenile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses\\nof protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senile\\nplaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding a\\ngroup of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Why\\nthese structures develop is unknown. Current research\\nindicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flow\\nrestriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as free\\nradicals. Several genes have been associated with higher\\nincidences of AD, although the exact role of these genes\\nis still unknown.\\nVascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5–30%\\nof all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow to\\nthe brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes\\n(multi-infarct dementia). Other cerebrovascular causes\\ninclude:vasculitis from syphilis, Lyme disease, or sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus ; subdural hematoma; and\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the usually sud-\\nden nature of its cause, the symptoms of vascular demen-\\ntia tend to begin more abruptly than those of Alzheimer’s\\ndementia. Symptoms may progress stepwise with the\\noccurrence of new strokes. Unlike AD, the incidence of\\nvascular dementia is lower after age 75.\\nOther conditions which may cause dementia\\ninclude:\\n• AIDS\\n• Parkinson’s disease\\n• Lewy body disease\\n• Pick’s disease\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1024\\nDementia'),\n",

Losses eventually\\naffect virtually every aspect of mental life. The slow pro-\\ngression of dementia is in contrast with delirium, which\\ninvolves some of the same symptoms, but has a very\\nrapid onset and fluctuating course with alteration in the\\nlevel of consciousness. However, delirium may occur\\nwith dementia, especially since the person with dementia\\nis more susceptible to the delirium-inducing effects of\\nmay types of drugs.\\nSymptoms include:\\n• Memory losses. Memory loss is usually the first symp-\\ntom noticed. It may begin with misplacing valuables\\nsuch as a wallet or car keys, then progress to forgetting\\nappointments, where the car was left, and the route\\nhome, for instance. More profound losses follow, such\\nas forgetting the names and faces of family members.\\n• Impaired abstraction and planning. The person with\\ndementia may lose the ability to perform familiar tasks, to\\nplan activities, and to draw simple conclusions from facts.\\n• Language and comprehension disturbances. The person\\nmay be unable to understand instructions, or follow the\\nlogic of moderately complex sentences. Later, he or she\\nmay not understand his or her own sentences, and have\\ndifficulty forming thoughts into words.\\n• Poor judgment. The person may not recognize the con-\\nsequences of his or her actions or be able to evaluate the\\nappropriateness of behavior. Behavior may become rib-\\nald, overly-friendly, or aggressive. Personal hygiene\\nmay be ignored.\\n• Impaired orientation ability. The person may not be\\nable to identify the time of day, even from obvious\\nvisual clues; or may not recognize his or her location,\\neven if familiar. This disability may stem partly from\\nlosses of memory and partly from impaired abstraction.\\n• Decreased attention and increased restlessness. This\\nmay cause the person with dementia to begin an activity\\nand quickly lose interest, and to wander frequently.\\nWandering may cause significant safety problems, when\\ncombined with disorientation and memory losses. The\\nperson may begin to cook something on the stove, then\\nbecome distracted and wander away while it is cooking.\\n• Personality changes and psychosis . The person may\\nlose interest in once-pleasurable activities, and become\\nmore passive, depressed, or anxious. Delusions, suspi-\\ncion, paranoia, and hallucinations may occur later in\\nthe disease. Sleep disturbances may occur, including\\ninsomniaand sleep interruptions.\\nDiagnosis\\nSince dementia usually progresses slowly, diagnos-\\ning it in its early stages can be difficult. Several office\\nvisits over several months or more may be needed. Diag-\\nnosis begins with a thorough physical exam and com-\\nplete medical history, usually including comments from\\nfamily members or caregivers. A family history of either\\nAD or cerebrovascular disease may provide clues to the\\ncause of symptoms. Simple tests of mental function,\\nincluding word recall, object naming, and number-sym-\\nbol matching, are used to track changes in the person’s\\ncognitive ability.\\nDepression is common in the elderly and can be\\nmistaken for dementia; therefore, ruling out depression is\\nan important part of the diagnosis. Distinguishing\\ndementia from the mild normal cognitive decline of\\nadvanced age is also critical. The medical history\\nincludes a complete listing of drugs being taken, since a\\nnumber of drugs can cause dementia-like symptoms.\\nDetermining the cause of dementia may require a\\nvariety of medical tests, chosen to match the most likely\\netiology. Cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, and\\ntumors may be diagnosed with x-rays, CT or MRI scans,\\nand vascular imaging studies. Blood tests may reveal\\nnutritional deficiencies or hormone imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of dementia begins with treatment of\\nthe underlying disease, where possible. The underlying\\ncauses of nutritional, hormonal, tumor-caused and\\ndrug-related dementias may be reversible to some\\nextent. Treatment for stroke-related dementia begins\\nby minimizing the risk of further strokes, through\\nsmokingcessation, aspirin therapy, and treatment of\\nhypertension , for instance.

The patient must learn to cope with functional\\nand cognitive limitations, while family members or other\\ncaregivers assume increasing responsibility for the per-\\nson’s physical needs. In progressive dementias such as\\nAD, the person may ultimately become completely\\ndependent. Education of the patient and family early on\\nin the disease progression can help them anticipate and\\nplan for inevitable changes.\\nSymptoms of dementia may be treated with a com-\\nbination of psychotherapy, environmental modifications,\\nand medication. Drug therapy can be complicated by for-\\ngetfulness, especially if the prescribed drug must be\\ntaken several times daily.\\nBehavioral approaches may be used to reduce the\\nfrequency or severity of problem behaviors, such as\\naggression or socially inappropriate conduct. Problem\\nbehavior may be a reaction to frustration or overstimula-\\ntion; understanding and modifying the situations that\\ntrigger it can be effective. Strategies may include break-\\ning down complex tasks, such as dressing or feeding,\\ninto simpler steps, or reducing the amount of activity in\\nthe environment to avoid confusion and agitation. Plea-\\nsurable activities, such as crafts, games, and music, can\\nprovide therapeutic stimulation and improve mood.\\nModifying the environment can increase safety and\\ncomfort while decreasing agitation. Home modifications\\nfor safety include removal or lock-up of hazards such as\\nsharp knives, dangerous chemicals, and tools. Child-\\nproof latches or Dutch doors may be used to limit access\\nas well. Lowering the hot water temperature to 120°F\\n(48.9°C) or less reduces the risk of scalding. Bed rails\\nand bathroom safety rails can be important safety mea-\\nsures, as well. Confusion may be reduced with simpler\\ndecorative schemes and presence of familiar objects.\\nCovering or disguising doors (with a mural, for example)\\nmay reduce the tendency to wander. Positioning the bed\\nin view of the bathroom can decrease incontinence.\\nTwo drugs, tacrine (Cognex) and donepezil (Ari-\\ncept), are commonly prescribed for AD. These drugs\\ninhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain, pro-\\nlonging its ability to conduct chemical messages between\\nbrain cells. They provide temporary improvement in cog-\\nnitive functions for about 40% of patients with mild to\\nmoderate AD. Hydergine is sometimes prescribed as\\nwell, though it is of questionable benefit for most\\npatients.\\nPsychotic symptoms, including paranoia, delusions,\\nand hallucinations, may be treated with antipsychotic\\ndrugs, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone,\\nand clozapine. Side effects of these drugs can be signifi-\\ncant. Antianxiety drugs such as Valium may improve\\nbehavioral symptoms, especially agitation and anxiety,\\nalthough BuSpar has fewer side effects. The anticonvul-\\nsant carbamazepine is also sometimes prescribed for agi-\\ntation. Depression is treated with antidepressants, usually\\nbeginning with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) such as Prozac or Paxil, followed by\\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitorsor tricyclic antidepres-\\nsants. Electroconvulsive therapymay be appropriate for\\nsome patients with severe depression who are unrespon-\\nsive to drug therapy. In general, medications should be\\nadministered very cautiously to demented patients, in the\\nlowest possible effective doses, to minimize side effects.\\nSupervision of taking medications is generally required.\\nLong-term institutional care may be needed for the\\nperson with dementia, as profound cognitive losses often\\nprecede death by a number of years. Early planning for\\nthe financial burden of nursing home care is critical. Use-\\nful information about financial planning for long-term\\ncare is available through the Alzheimer’s Association.\\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\\ndementia are often subject to extreme stress, and may\\ndevelop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopeless-\\nness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for their loved one\\nand for themselves. Depression is an extremely common\\nconsequence of being a full-time caregiver for a person\\nwith dementia. Support groups can be an important way\\nto deal with the stress of caregiving. The location and\\ncontact numbers for caregiver support groups are avail-\\nable from the Alzheimer’s Association; they may also be\\navailable through a local social service agency or the\\npatient’s physician. Medical treatment for depression may\\nbe an important adjunct to group support.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral drugs are currently being tested for their\\nability to slow the progress of AD.

These mosqui-\\ntoes then transmit the virus to humans.\\nDescription\\nThe virus that causes dengue fever is called an\\narbovirus, which stands for arthropod-borne virus. Mos-\\nquitoes are a type of arthropod. In a number of regions,\\nmosquitoes carry this virus and are responsible for pass-\\ning it along to humans. These regions include the Middle\\nEast, the far East, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands. In\\nthese locations, the dengue fever arbovirus is endemic,\\nmeaning that the virus naturally and consistently lives in\\nthat location. The disease only shows up in the United\\nStates sporadically.\\nIn order to understand how dengue fever is transmit-\\nted, several terms need to be defined. The word “host”\\nmeans an animal (including a human) that can be infect-\\ned with a particular disease. The word “vector” means an\\norganism that can carry a particular disease-causing\\nagent (like a virus or bacteria) without actually develop-\\ning the disease. The vector can then pass the virus or bac-\\nteria on to a new host.\\nMany of the common illnesses in the United States\\n(including the common cold, many viral causes of diar-\\nrhea, and influenza or “flu”) are spread because the\\nviruses that cause these illness can be passed directly\\nfrom person to person. However, dengue fever cannot be\\npassed directly from one infected person to another.\\nInstead, the virus responsible for dengue fever requires\\nan intermediate vector, a mosquito, that carries the virus\\nfrom one host to another. The mosquito that carries the\\narbovirus responsible for dengue fever is the same type\\nof mosquito that can transmit other diseases, including\\nyellow fever. This mosquito is called Aedes egypti. The\\nmost common victims are children younger than 10 years\\nof age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDengue fever can occur when a mosquito carrying\\nthe arbovirus bites a human, passing the virus on to the\\nnew host. Once in the body, the virus travels to various\\nglands where it multiplies. The virus can then enter the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1027\\nDengue fever'),\n",

The presence of the virus within the blood\\nvessels, especially those feeding the skin, causes changes\\nto these blood vessels. The vessels swell and leak. The\\nspleen and lymph nodes become enlarged, and patches of\\nliver tissue die. A process called disseminated intravascu-\\nlar coagulation (DIC) occurs, where chemicals responsi-\\nble for clotting are used up and lead to a risk of severe\\nbleeding (hemorrhage).\\nAfter the virus has been transmitted to the human\\nhost, a period of incubation occurs. During this time (last-\\ning about five to eight days) the virus multiplies. Symp-\\ntoms of the disease appear suddenly and include high\\nfever, chills, headache, eye pain, red eyes, enlarged\\nlymph nodes, a red flush to the face, lower back pain,\\nextreme weakness, and severe aches in the legs and joints.\\nThis initial period of illness lasts about two–three\\ndays. After this time, the fever drops rapidly and the\\npatient sweats heavily. After about a day of feeling rela-\\ntively well, the patient’s temperature increases again,\\nalthough not as much as the first time. A rash of small\\nred bumps begins on the arms and legs, spreading to the\\nchest, abdomen, and back. It rarely affects the face. The\\npalms of the hands and the soles of the feet become\\nswollen and turn bright red. The characteristic combina-\\ntion of fever, rash, and headache are called the “dengue\\ntriad.” Most people recover fully from dengue fever,\\nalthough weakness and fatigue may last for several\\nweeks. Once a person has been infected with dengue\\nfever, his or her immune system keeps producing cells\\nthat prevent reinfection for about a year.\\nMore severe illness may occur in some people.\\nThese people may be experiencing dengue fever for the\\nfirst time. However, in some cases a person may have\\nalready had dengue fever at one time, recovered, and\\nthen is reinfected with the virus. In these cases, the first\\ninfection teaches the immune system to recognize the\\npresence of the arbovirus. When the immune cells\\nencounter the virus during later infections, the immune\\nsystem over-reacts. These types of illnesses, called\\ndengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syn-\\ndrome (DSS), involve more severe symptoms. Fever and\\nheadache are the first symptoms, but the other initial\\nsymptoms of dengue fever are absent. The patient devel-\\nops a cough, followed by the appearance of small pur-\\nplish spots (petechiae) on the skin. These petechiae are\\nareas where blood is leaking out of the vessels. Large\\nbruised areas appear as the bleeding worsens and abdom-\\ninal pain may be severe. The patient may begin to vomit\\na substance that looks like coffee grounds. This is actual-\\nly a sign of bleeding into the stomach. As the blood ves-\\nsels become more damaged, they leak more and continue\\nto increase in diameter (dilate), causing a decrease in\\nblood flow to all tissues of the body. This state of low\\nblood flow is called shock. Shock can result in damage to\\nthe body’s organs (especially the heart and kidneys)\\nbecause low blood flow deprives them of oxygen.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis should be suspected in endemic areas when-\\never a high fever goes on for two to seven days, especially if\\naccompanied by a bleeding tendency. Symptoms of shock\\nshould suggest the progression of the disease to DSS.\\nThe arbovirus causing dengue fever is one of the few\\ntypes of arbovirus that can be isolated from the serum of\\nthe blood. The serum is the fluid in which blood cells are\\nsuspended. Serum can be tested because the phase in\\nwhich the virus travels throughout the bloodstream is\\nlonger in dengue fever than in other arboviral infections.\\nA number of tests are used to look for reactions between\\nthe patient’s serum and laboratory-produced antibodies.\\nAntibodies are special cells that recognize the markers\\n(or antigens) present on invading organisms. During\\nthese tests, antibodies are added to a sample of the\\npatient’s serum. Healthcare workers then look for reac-\\ntions that would only occur if viral antigens were present\\nin that serum.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment available to shorten the course\\nof dengue fever, DHF, or DSS. Medications can be given\\nto lower the fever and to decrease the pain of muscle\\naches and headaches. Fluids are given through a needle\\nin a vein to prevent dehydration . Blood transfusions\\nmay be necessary if severe hemorrhaging occurs. Oxy-\\ngen should be administered to patients in shock.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for uncomplicated dengue fever is\\nvery good, and almost 100% of patients fully recover.\\nHowever, as many as 6–30% of all patients die when\\nDHF occurs. The death rate is especially high among the\\nyoungest patients (under one year old). In places where\\nexcellent medical care is available, very close monitoring\\nand immediate treatment of complications lowers the\\ndeath rate among DHF and DSS patients to about 1%.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of dengue fever means decreasing the\\nmosquito population. Any sources of standing water\\n(buckets, vases, etc.) where the mosquitoes can breed\\nmust be eliminated. Mosquito repellant is recommended\\nfor those areas where dengue fever is endemic.

Depending on the position of the frac-\\nture, the tooth may or may not cause toothache pain.\\nWhen a tooth is knocked out (evulsed), the socket is\\nswollen, painful, and bloody. A jawbone may be broken\\nif the upper and lower teeth no longer fit together proper-\\nly (malocclusion ), or if the jaws have pain with limited\\nability to open and close (mobility), especially around\\nthe temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\\nDiagnosis\\nDental trauma is readily apparent upon examination.\\nDental x rays may be taken to determine the extent of the\\ndamage to broken teeth. More comprehensive x rays are\\nneeded to diagnose a broken jaw.\\nTreatment\\nSoft tissue injuries may require only cold compress-\\nes to reduce swelling. Bleeding may be controlled with\\ndirect pressure applied with clean gauze. Deep lacera-\\ntions and punctures may require stitches. Pain may be\\nmanaged with aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol,\\nAspirin Free Excedrin) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).\\nTreatment of a broken tooth will vary depending on\\nthe severity of the fracture. For immediate first aid, the\\ninjured tooth and surrounding area should be rinsed gen-\\ntly with warm water to remove dirt, then covered with a\\ncold compress to reduce swelling and ease pain. A dentist\\nshould examine the injury as soon as possible. Any pieces\\nfrom the broken tooth should be saved and brought along.\\nIf a piece of the outer tooth has chipped off, but the\\ninner core (pulp) is undisturbed, the dentist may simply\\nsmooth the rough edges or replace the missing section\\nwith a small composite filling. In some cases, a fragment\\nof broken tooth may be bonded back into place. If\\nenough tooth is missing to compromise the entire tooth\\nstructure, but the pulp is not permanently damaged, the\\ntooth will require a protective coverage with a gold or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1029\\nDental trauma'),\n",

A tooth that is vertically fractured or\\nfractured below the gumline will require root canal treat-\\nment and protective restoration. A tooth which no longer\\nhas enough remaining structure to retain a crown may\\nhave to be extracted (surgically removed).\\nWhen a permanent tooth has been knocked out, it\\nmay be saved with prompt action. The tooth must be\\nfound immediately after it has been lost. It should be\\npicked up by the natural crown (the top part covered by\\nhard enamel). It must not be handled by the root.

Cal-\\nendula (Calendula officinalis ) and plantain ( Plantago\\nmajor) can be used as a mouth rinse to enhance tissue\\nhealing. These herbs should not be used with deep lacera-\\ntions that need to heal from the inside first.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen dental trauma receives timely attention and\\nproper treatment, the prognosis for healing is good. As\\nwith other types of trauma, infection may be a complica-\\ntion, but a course of antibiotics is generally effective.\\nPrevention\\nMost dental trauma is preventable.

Depo-Provera is also a hormone, but is administered\\nby intramuscular injection and provides protection against\\npregnancyfor three months. Lunelle is another injectable\\ncontraceptive that is administered monthly (every 28 to 30\\ndays); it was approved by the Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion (FDA) in October 2000. The hormone in Norplant and\\nDepo-Provera is progestin, a synthetic hormone similar to\\none found naturally in a woman’s body; Lunelle contains\\nthe hormones progestin and estrogen.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of these hormones is to prevent preg-\\nnancy; they are about 99% effective in achieving this\\ngoal. No hormonal contraceptive methods provide protec-\\ntion from AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases.\\nDepo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection\\nand work in several ways to prevent conception. First,\\nthe egg (ovum) is prevented from maturing and being\\nreleased. The mucus in the cervix (opening into the\\nuterus or womb) becomes thicker, making it difficult for\\nthe sperm to enter. Depo-Provera and Lunelle also cause\\nthe lining of the uterus to become thinner, making\\nimplantation of a fertilized egg unlikely.\\nAn injection of Depo-Provera or Lunelle must be\\ngiven within the first five days of a normal period. Depo-\\nProvera provides protection against pregnancy for three\\nmonths, while Lunelle provides similar protection for\\none month. Ovulation (release of a mature egg) typically\\noccurs within 60 days of the last injection of Lunelle,\\nabout twice as fast after use of Depo-Provera. Also,\\nbecause Lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive as\\nopposed to progestin-only Depo-Provera and Norplant, it\\nis less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation.\\nNorplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that\\nis slowly released over a period of up to five years. It\\nfunctions like Depo-Provera in that it prevents the\\novaries from producing ova (eggs) and also results in\\nthicker mucus in the cervix, which prevents the sperm\\nfrom passing through the cervix. Norplant can be insert-\\ned at any time.\\nPreparation\\nThe woman being considered for Depo-Provera or\\nLunelle will have a pelvic and breast examination, a Pap\\ntest (a microscopic examination of cell samples taken\\nfrom the cervix), blood pressure check, weight check,\\nand a review of her medical history. Women who have\\ndiabetes mellitus, major depression, blood clotting\\nproblems, liver disease, or weight problems should use\\nthese methods only under strict medical supervision.\\nDepo-Provera or Lunelle should not be used if the\\nwoman is pregnant, has unexplained vaginal bleeding,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1031\\nDepo-Provera/Norplant\\nA physician inserts a contraceptive implant under the skin\\nof a woman’s arm.\\n(Photo Researchers, Inc.

But when these depressed feel-\\nings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical\\nand mental deterioration, they become what are known\\nas depressive disorders. Each year in the United\\nStates, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17\\nmillion people at an approximate annual direct and\\nindirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like-\\nly to experience an episode of severe depression in her\\nlifetime, with a 10–20% lifetime prevalence, com-\\npared to 5–10% for men. The average age a first\\ndepressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, although\\nthe disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately,\\nfrom children to the elderly.\\nThere are two main categories of depressive disor-\\nders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.\\nMajor depressive disorder is a moderate to severe\\nepisode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi-\\nviduals experiencing this major depressive episode may\\nhave trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they once\\ntook pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif-\\nficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or\\nhave a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children,\\nthe major depression may appear as irritability.\\nWhile major depressive episodes may be acute\\n(intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo-\\ning, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (one\\nor more years in children) and has an average duration of\\n16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic\\ndisorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflicted\\nwith the disorder may experience some periods of nor-\\nmal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length.\\nIts onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not be\\nable to pinpoint exactly when they started feeling\\ndepressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder may\\nexperience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, low\\nself-esteem,fatigue, trouble concentrating, and feelings\\nof hopelessness.\\nDepression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n\\naffective mental illness that causes radical emotional\\nchanges and mood swings, from manic highs to depres-\\nsive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience\\nalternating episodes of mania and depression.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes behind depression are complex and not\\nyet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu-\\nrotransmitters—the chemicals in the brain that transmit\\nmessages between nerve cell— is believed to be key to\\ndepression, external factors such as upbringing (more so\\nin dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor-\\ntant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is\\nabused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles-\\ncence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking\\nmay emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression\\nmay follow.\\nHeredity does seem to play a role in who develops\\ndepressive disorders. Individuals with major depression\\nin their immediate family are up to three times more\\nlikely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem\\nthat biological and genetic factors may make certain\\nindividuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor-\\nders, but environmental circumstances may often trig-\\nger the disorder.\\nExternal stressors and significant life changes, such\\nas chronic medical problems, death of a loved one,\\ndivorce or estrangement,miscarriage , or loss of a job,\\ncan also result in a form of depression known as adjust-\\nment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder\\nusually resolve themselves, occasionally they may\\nevolve into a major depressive disorder.\\nMajor depressive episode\\nIndividuals experiencing a major depressive episode\\nhave a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or\\npleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major\\ndepressive episode may appear or feel irritable rather\\nthan depressed. In addition, five or more of the following\\nsymptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri-\\nod of at least two weeks:\\n• Significant change in weight.\\n•Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep).\\n• Psychomotor agitation or retardation.\\n• Fatigue or loss of energy.\\n• Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt.\\n• Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci-\\nsiveness.\\n• Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide\\nattempts.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1033\\nDepressive disorders\\nSigns Of Mental Depression\\nDepressed mood\\nLack of interest or pleasure in daily activities\\nSignificant weight loss (without dieting) or weight gain\\nDifficulty sleeping or excessive sleeping\\nLoss of energy\\nFeelings of worthlessness or guilt\\nDifficulty in making decisions\\nRestlessness\\nRecurrent thoughts of death'),\n",

Dysthymia is prevalent\\nin patients with certain medical conditions, including mul-\\ntiple sclerosis, AIDS, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome, Parkinson’s disease , diabetes, and post-car-\\ndiac transplantation.

There are several differ-\\nent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the common\\ngoal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv-\\ning and coping skills.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the\\npatient’s faulty thinking is causing the current depression\\nand focuses on changing the depressed patient’s thought\\npatterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patient\\nidentify negative or distorted thought patterns and the\\nemotions and behavior that accompany them, and then\\nretrains the depressed individual to recognize the think-\\ning and react differently to it.\\nElectroconvulsant therapy\\nECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually\\nemployed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment\\noptions have been explored. However, it is sometimes used\\nearly in treatment when severe depression is present and\\nthe patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient is\\nbecoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic.\\nThe treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses\\nthat move into the brain through electrodes on the\\npatient’s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia\\nand patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre-\\nvent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind\\nthe success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed\\nthat the electrical current modifies the electrochemical\\nprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-\\nsion.

Contact\\ndermatitis usually does not spread from one person to\\nanother, nor does it spread beyond the area exposed to\\nthe irritant unless affected skin comes into contact with\\nanother part of the body. However, in the case of some\\nirritants, such as poison ivy, contact dermatitis can be\\npassed to another person or to another part of the body.\\nStasis dermatitis is characterized by scaly, greasy\\nlooking skin on the lower legs and around the ankles. Sta-\\nsis dermatitis is most apt to affect the inner side of the calf.\\nNummular dermatitis, which is also called nummular\\neczematous dermatitis or nummular eczema, generally\\naffects the hands, arms, legs, and buttocks of men and\\nwomen older than 55 years of age. This stubborn\\ninflamed rash forms circular, sometimes itchy, patches\\nand is characterized by flares and periods of inactivity.\\nAtopic dermatitis is characterized by itching, scal-\\ning, swelling, and sometimes blistering. In early child-\\nhood it is called infantile eczema and is characterized by\\nredness, oozing, and crusting. It is usually found on the\\nface, inside the elbows, and behind the knees.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis may be dry or moist and is\\ncharacterized by greasy scales and yellowish crusts on the\\nscalp, eyelids, face, external surfaces of the ears, under-\\narms, breasts, and groin. In infants it is called “cradle cap.”\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergic reactions are genetically determined, and\\ndifferent substances cause contact dermatitis to develop\\nin different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi-\\nson ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com-\\nmon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most common\\nallergy in this country, affecting one of every two people\\nin the United States.\\nFlowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the\\nskin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the\\nrisk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants that\\ncan cause the condition include:\\n• chlorine\\n• cleansers\\n• detergents and soaps\\n• fabric softeners\\n• glues used on artificial nails\\n• perfumes\\n• topical medications\\nContact dermatitis can develop when the first con-\\ntact occurs or after years of use or exposure.\\nStasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,\\noccurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to the\\nheart as efficiently as they once did.

DES is a synthetic hormone, related to\\nestrogen. Since up to 20% of all pregnancies end in mis-\\ncarriage , this seemed like an important breakthrough\\nand DES was prescribed for many women who had\\nbleeding in early pregnancy. Ultimately, it was found to\\nhave no effect on miscarriages and the practice of pre-\\nscribing DES was stopped in the 1960s. Almost 10 years\\nlater, the daughters of women who had taken DES during\\npregnancy began to develop unusual symptoms.\\nDoctors discovered that when these young women\\nreached their teens, they were at higher risk for a variety\\nof problems, including:\\n• clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix\\n• infertility\\n•premature labor and other problems in pregnancy\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDES has affected a very specific group of women.\\nThese are women who were exposed to DES in utero\\nbefore 18 weeks of pregnancy.

Up until that time, doctors had seen these\\ncancers only in elderly women. Suddenly, young women\\nwho had the disease appeared.\\nThis was so unusual that researchers studied these\\nwomen to see if they had anything in common. After a\\ngreat deal of questioning and examination, it was found\\nthat they all had one factor in common. All of the young\\nwomen had been exposed to DES in utero in the early\\nweeks of pregnancy.\\nToday, it is difficult to imagine how shocking this\\ndiscovery was. Doctors had only recently recognized that\\nmedications and exposure to chemicals during pregnancy\\ncould cause birth defects . This was a birth defect that\\nhad gone undetected for almost two decades.\\nSince then, doctors have studied DES daughters very\\ncarefully. Fortunately, the risk of clear cell adenocarcino-\\nma is actually quite low. In fact, it appears that if a DES\\ndaughter has not developed this cancer by age 30, she\\nwill not develop it. Since all DES daughters are now over\\nage 30, there should be no further cases related to DES\\nexposure. However, there are a number of other symp-\\ntoms and problems associated with DES exposure.\\n• Cervix and vagina. DES daughters often have distinc-\\ntive changes of the cervix and vagina that can be seen\\nduring a pelvic exam. These changes include a cervical\\nhood (a vaginal fold draped over the cervix),\\ncockscomb cervix (an abnormally shaped cervix), and\\nadenosis (glandular cells normally located within the\\ncervix that appear on the outside of the cervix and in\\nthe vagina).\\nKEY TERMS\\nCervix—The opening at the bottom of the uterus.\\nColposcopy—A special examination of the cervix\\nusing a magnifying scope. This is a procedure that\\ncan be done in the doctor’s office.\\nFallopian tubes—The tubes that carry the ovum\\n(egg) from the ovary to the uterus.\\nPap smear—A screening test for precancerous and\\ncancerous cells on the cervix. This simple test is\\ndone during a routine pelvic exam and involves\\nscraping cells from the cervix.\\n• Fallopian tubes. Some DES daughters have fallopian\\ntube abnormalities that lead to infertility.\\n• Uterus. Many DES daughters have a uterus that is\\nabnormal in size and shape. The classic sign is the T-\\nshaped uterus. In the normal uterus, the cavity (hollow\\nspace inside) is rounded. In a T-shaped uterus, the cavi-\\nty is reduced to a thin T. The abnormal shape of the\\ninside of the uterus makes it harder for a woman to get\\npregnant and leads to a higher risk of premature labor\\nand birth.\\nDiagnosis\\nWomen who have been exposed to DES should have\\na pelvic exam at least once a year. In addition to the usual\\npelvic exam and Pap smear, DES daughters should also\\nhave Pap smears of the vagina and, if possible,col-\\nposcopy . During colposcopy, the doctor looks at the\\ncervix and vagina through a special magnifying scope. In\\nthis way, tiny areas of abnormal cells can be seen. This\\nprocedure is easily performed in the doctor’s office.\\nWhen DES daughters get pregnant, they may be at\\nhigh risk for premature labor and birth and should be\\nmonitored very carefully.\\nNot all women who were exposed to DES develop\\nproblems in pregnancy. However, if problems like infer-\\ntility or miscarriage do occur, the doctor may recom-\\nmend a special x-ray test to check the woman’s fallopian\\ntubes and uterus. This special test is called a hysterosalp-\\ningogram.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment for the abnormalities of the\\nfallopian tubes and uterus caused by DES exposure.

It is based on\\nthe principle that illnesses can be caused by the accumu-\\nlation of toxic substances (toxins) in the body. Eliminat-\\ning existing toxins and avoiding new toxins are essential\\nparts of the healing process. Detoxification utilizes a\\nvariety of tests and techniques.\\nPurpose\\nDetoxification is helpful for those patients suffering\\nfrom many chronic diseases and conditions, including\\nallergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, chronic infections,\\ndepression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high\\ncholesterol, low blood sugar levels, digestive disorders,\\nmental illness, and obesity . It is helpful for those with\\nconditions that are influenced by environmental factors,\\nsuch as cancer , as well as for those who have been\\nexposed to high levels of toxic materials due to accident\\nor occupation. Detoxification therapy is useful for those\\nsuffering from allergies or immune system problems\\nthat conventional medicine is unable to diagnose or\\ntreat, including chronic fatigue syndrome , environ-\\nmental illness/multiple chemical sensitivity, and\\nfibromyalgia. Symptoms for those suffering these con-\\nditions may include unexplained fatigue , increased\\nallergies, hypersensitivity to common materials, intoler-\\nance to certain foods and indigestion , aches and pains,\\nlow grade fever, headaches, insomnia, depression, sore\\nthroats, sudden weight loss or gain, lowered resistance\\nto infection, general malaise, and disability. Detoxifica-\\ntion can be used as a beneficial preventative measure\\nand as a tool to increase overall health, vitality, and\\nresistance to disease.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nDetoxification methods of healing have been used for\\nthousands of years. Fasting, is one of the oldest therapeu-\\ntic practices in medicine. Hippocrates, the ancient Greek\\nknown as the “Father of Western medicine,” recommend-\\ned fasting as a means for improving health. Ayurvedic\\nmedicine, a traditional healing system that has developed\\nover thousands of years, utilizes detoxification methods\\nto treat many chronic conditions and to prevent illness.\\nDetoxification treatment has become one of the cor-\\nnerstones of alternative medicine. Conventional medicine\\nnotes that environmental factors can play a significant role\\nin many illnesses. Environmental medicine is a field that\\nstudies exactly how those environmental factors influence\\ndisease. Conditions such as asthma, cancer, chronic\\nfatigue syndrome,multiple chemical sensitivity , and\\nmany others are strongly influenced by exposure to toxic\\nor allergenic substances in the environment. The United\\nStates Centers for Disease Control estimate that over 80%\\nof all illnesses have environmental and lifestyle causes.\\nDetoxification has also become a prominent treat-\\nment as people have become more aware of environmen-\\ntal pollution. It is estimated that one in every four Ameri-\\ncans suffers from some level of heavy metal poisoning.\\nHeavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and\\narsenic, are by-products of industry. Synthetic agricul-\\nture chemicals, many of which are known to cause health\\nproblems, are also found in food, air, and water. Ameri-\\ncan agriculture uses nearly 10 lb (4.5 kg) of pesticides\\nper person on the food supply each year. These toxins\\nhave become almost unavoidable. Pesticides that are\\nused only on crops in the southern United States have\\nbeen found in the tissue of animals in the far north of\\nCanada. DDT, a cancer-causing insecticide that has been\\nbanned for decades, is still regularly found in the fatty\\ntissue of animals, birds, and fish, even in extremely\\nremote regions such as the North Pole.\\nThe problem of toxins in the environment is com-\\npounded because humans are at the top of the food chain\\nand are more likely to be exposed to an accumulation of\\ntoxic substances in the food supply. For instance, pesti-\\ncides and herbicides are sprayed on grains that are then\\nfed to farm animals. Toxic substances are stored in the\\nfatty tissue of those animals. In addition, those animals\\nare often injected with synthetic hormones,antibiotics ,\\nand other chemicals. When people eat meat products,\\nthey are exposed to the full range of chemicals and addi-\\ntives used along the entire agricultural chain. Detoxifica-\\ntion specialists call this build up of toxins bioaccumula-\\ntion. They assert that the bioaccumulation of toxic sub-\\nstances over time is responsible for many physical and\\nmental disorders, especially ones that are increasing\\nrapidly (like asthma, cancer, and mental illness). As a\\nresult, detoxification therapies are increasing in impor-\\ntance and popularity.\\nToxins in the body include heavy metals and various\\nchemicals such as pesticides, pollutants, and food addi-\\ntives. Drugs and alcohol have toxic effects in the body.\\nToxins are produced as normal by-products in the\\nintestines by the bacteria that break down food. The diges-\\ntion of protein also creates toxic by-products in the body.\\nThe body has natural methods of detoxification.\\nIndividual cells get detoxified in the lymph and circula-\\ntory system.

Toxins can\\nbe excreted from the body by the kidneys, bowels, skin,\\nand lungs. Detoxification treatments become necessary\\nwhen the body’s natural detoxification systems become\\noverwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects of\\nimproper diet,stress, overeating, sedentary lifestyles, ill-\\nness, and poor health habits in general. When a build up\\nof toxic substances in the body creates illness, it’s called\\ntoxemia. Some people’s digestive tracts become unable\\nto digest food properly, due to years of overeating and\\ndietsthat are high in fat and processed foods and low in\\nfiber (the average American diet). When this happens,\\nfood cannot pass through the digestive tract efficiently.\\nInstead of being digested properly or eliminated from the\\nbowel, food can literally rot inside the digestive tract and\\nproduce toxic by-products. This state is known as toxic\\ncolon syndrome or intestinal toxemia.\\nDetoxification therapies try to activate and assist the\\nbody’s own detoxification processes. They also try to\\neliminate additional exposure to toxins and strengthen\\nthe body and immune system so that toxic imbalances\\nwon’t occur in the future.\\nTesting for toxic substances\\nDetoxification specialists use a variety of tests to\\ndetermine the causes contributing to toxic conditions.\\nThese causes include infections, allergies, addictions,\\ntoxic chemicals, and digestive and organ dysfunction.\\nBlood, urine, stool, and hair analyses, as well as allergy\\ntests, are used to measure a variety of bodily functions\\nthat may indicate problems. Detoxification therapists\\nusually have access to laboratories that specialize in\\nsophisticated diagnostic tests for toxic conditions.\\nPeople who have toxemia are often susceptible to\\ninfection because their immune systems are weakened.\\nInfections can be caused by parasites, bacteria, viruses,\\nand a common yeast. Therapists will screen patients for\\nunderlying infections that may be contributing to illness.\\nLiver function is studied closely with blood and\\nurine tests because the liver is the principle organ in the\\nbody responsible for removing toxic compounds. When\\nthe liver detoxifies a substance from the body, it does so\\nin two phases. Tests are performed that indicate where\\nproblems may be occurring in these phases, which may\\npoint to specific types of toxins. Blood and urine tests\\ncan also be completed that screen for toxic chemicals\\nsuch as PCBs (environmental poisons), formaldehyde (a\\ncommon preservative), pesticides, and heavy metals.\\nAnother useful blood test is a test for zinc deficiency,\\nwhich may reveal heavy metal poisoning. Hair analysis\\nis used to test for heavy metal levels in the body. Blood\\nand urine tests check immune system activity, and hor-\\nmone levels can also indicate specific toxic compounds.\\nA 24-hour urine analysis, where samples are taken\\naround the clock, allows therapists to determine the effi-\\nciency of the digestive tract and kidneys. Together with\\nstool analysis, these tests may indicate toxic bowel syn-\\ndrome and digestive system disorders. Certain blood and\\nurine tests may point to nutritional deficiencies and prop-\\ner recovery diets can be designed for patients as well.\\nDetoxification therapists may also perform extensive\\nallergy and hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal (between\\nlayers of the skin) and sublingual (under the tongue)\\nallergy tests are used to determine a patient’s sensitivity\\nto a variety of common substances, including formalde-\\nhyde, auto exhaust, perfume, tobacco, chlorine, jet fuel,\\nand other chemicals.\\nFood allergies require additional tests because these\\nallergies often cause reactions that are delayed for several\\ndays after the food is eaten. The RAST (radioallergosor-\\nbent test) is a blood test that determines the level of anti-\\nbodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood after specific\\nfoods are eaten. The cytotoxic test is a blood test that\\ndetermines if certain substances affect blood cells, includ-\\ning foods and chemicals. The ELISA-ACT (enzyme-\\nlinked immunoserological assay activated cell test) is\\nconsidered to be one of the most accurate tests for aller-\\ngies and hypersensitivity to foods, chemicals, and other\\nagents. Other tests for food allergies are the elimination\\nand rotation diets, in which foods are systematically eval-\\nuated to determine the ones that are causing problems.\\nDetoxification therapists usually interview and\\ncounsel patients closely to determine and correct\\nlifestyle, occupational, psychological, and emotional fac-\\ntors that may also be contributing to illness.\\nDetoxification therapies\\nDetoxification therapists use a variety of healing\\ntechniques after a diagnosis is made. The first step is to\\neliminate a patient’s exposure to all toxic or allergenic\\nsubstances. These include heavy metals, chemicals, radi-\\nation (from x rays, power lines, cell phones, computer\\nscreens, and microwaves), smog, polluted water, foods,\\ndrugs,caffeine , alcohol, perfume, excess noise, and\\nstress. If mercury poisoning has been determined, the\\npatient will be advised to have mercury fillings from the\\nteeth removed, preferably by a holistic dentist.\\nSpecific treatments are used to stimulate and assist\\nthe body’s detoxification process. Dietary change is\\nimmediately enacted, eliminating allergic and unhealthy\\nfoods, and emphasizing foods that assist detoxification\\nand support healing. Detoxification diets are generally\\nlow in fat, high in fiber, and vegetarian with a raw food\\nemphasis. Processed foods, alcohol, and caffeine are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1042\\nDetoxification'),\n",

Nutritional supplements such as vitamins, min-\\nerals, antioxidants, amino acids, and essential fatty acids\\nare often prescribed. Spirulina is a sea algae that is fre-\\nquently given to assist in eliminating heavy metals.\\nLipotropic agents are certain vitamins and nutrients that\\npromote the flow of bile and fat from the liver.\\nMany herbal supplements are used in detoxification\\ntherapies as well. Milk thistle extract, called silymarin, is\\none of the more potent herbs for detoxifying the liver.\\nNaturopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, and traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine (TCM) recommend numerous herbal for-\\nmulas for detoxification and immune strengthening. If\\ninfections or parasites have been found, these are treated\\nwith herbal formulas and, in difficult cases, antibiotics. \\nFor toxic bowel syndrome and digestive tract disor-\\nders, herbal laxatives and high fiber foods such as psylli-\\num seeds may be given to cleanse the digestive tract and\\npromote elimination. Colonics are used to cleanse the\\nlower intestines. Digestive enzymes are prescribed to\\nimprove digestion, and acidophilus and other friendly\\nbacteria are reintroduced into the system with nutritional\\nsupplements.\\nFasting is another major therapy in detoxification.\\nFasting is one of the quickest ways to promote the elimina-\\ntion of stored toxins in the body and to prompt the healing\\nprocess. People with severe toxic conditions are supervised\\nclosely during fasting because the number of toxins in the\\nbody temporarily increases as they are being released.\\nChelation therapy is used by detoxification special-\\nists to rid the body of heavy metals. Chelates are particu-\\nlar substances that bind to heavy metals and speed their\\nelimination. Homeopathic remedies have also been\\nshown to be effective for removing heavy metals.\\nSweating therapies can also detoxify the body\\nbecause the skin is a major organ of elimination. Sweating\\nhelps release those toxins that are stored in the subcuta-\\nneous (under the skin) fat cells. Saunas, therapeutic baths,\\nand exercise are some of these treatments. Body therapies\\nmay also be prescribed, including massage therapy, acu-\\npressure, shiatsu, manual lymph drainage, and polarity\\ntherapy. These body therapies seek to improve circulatory\\nand structural problems, reduce stress, and promote heal-\\ning responses in the body.

Toward\\nthe back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, but\\nfurther forward the bone becomes cartilage. With one\\nfinger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bent\\nback and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis-\\nplaced to one side, it will impede the flow of air and\\nmucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat-\\ned septum, can cause symptoms and disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor-\\nmal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow-\\ning of the nasal passageway that it causes will threaten\\nthe drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which must\\npass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicine\\nthat when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus from\\nthe sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results.\\nPeople with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater\\nrisk of obstruction because their nasal passageways are\\nalready narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them.\\nThe result is sinusitis, which can be acute and severe or\\nchronic and lingering.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more\\ndifficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. It\\nis common for a patient to complain that he/she can\\nbreathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis is\\neasy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring,\\nsleep apnea, and other breathing disorders.\\nTreatment\\nThe definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of\\nthe septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixing\\nit in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like\\npseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink the\\nmembranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista-\\nmines, nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat-\\nments may also be temporarily beneficial.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAs a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help-\\nful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent-\\ning drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hot\\npeppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears and\\ndischarge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even more\\neffective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often done\\nusing a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is poured\\ninto one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril.\\nThen, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies\\nare all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correct\\nthe problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflated\\nballoon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a large\\nenough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be an\\nalternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in the\\nnasospecific procedure is necessary.\\nPrognosis\\nSurgical repair is curative and carries little risk.\\nChronic infection can be painful and lead to complica-\\ntions until it is resolved. If there is continued obstruction,\\nthe infection will very likely return.\\nPrevention\\nAvoidance of virus colds, airborne dusts, air pollu-\\ntion, and known allergens will minimize the irritation\\nand swelling of the membranes lining the nasal passages.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1045\\nDeviated septum\\nA close-up of person with a deviated septum.(Custom Med-\\nical Stock Photo.

One important chemi-\\ncal involved in fluid balance is called antidiuretic hor-\\nmone (ADH). ADH is produced by the pituitary, a small\\ngland located at the base of the brain.

Normal saline has\\nthe same salt concentration as the body, 0.9%.\\nSinuses—The nasal sinuses, air-filled cavities sur-\\nrounding the eyes and nose, like the nose itself are\\nlined with mucus-producing membranes. They\\nprovide cleansing to the nose, resonance to the\\nvoice, and structure to the face.\\nSinusitis—Infection of the sinuses.\\nSleep apnea —A condition in which breathing is\\ntemporarily interrupted during sleep. It leads to\\nhigh blood pressure, sleepiness, and a variety of\\nother problems.\\nreleased. ADH influences the amount of fluid that the\\nkidneys reabsorb into the circulatory system and the\\namount of fluid that the kidneys pass out of the body in\\nthe form of urine.\\nProduction of ADH is regulated by the osmolality of\\nthe circulating blood. Osmolality refers to the concentra-\\ntion of dissolved chemicals (such as sodium, potassium,\\nand chloride; together called solute) circulating in the\\nfluid base of the blood (plasma). When there is very little\\nfluid compared to the concentration of solute, the pitu-\\nitary will increase ADH production. This tells the kid-\\nneys to retain more water and to decrease the amount of\\nurine produced. As fluid is retained, the concentration of\\nsolute will normalize. At other times, when the fluid con-\\ntent of the blood is high in comparison to the concentra-\\ntion of solute, ADH production will decrease. The kid-\\nneys are then free to pass an increased amount of fluid\\nout of the body in the urine. Again, this will allow the\\nplasma osmolality to return to normal.\\nDiabetes insipidus occurs when either the amount of\\nADH produced by the pituitary is below normal (central\\nDI), or the kidneys’ ability to respond to ADH is defective\\n(nephrogenic DI). In either case, a person with DI will\\npass extraordinarily large quantities of urine, sometimes\\nreaching 10 or more liters each day. At the same time, the\\npatient’s blood will be very highly concentrated, with low\\nfluid volume and high concentrations of solute.\\nDI occurs on average when a person is about 24\\nyears old, and occurs more frequently in males than in\\nfemales.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDI may run in families. The cause of this type of DI\\nis unknown. Other times, central DI can be caused by:\\n• an injury to the head\\n• brain surgery\\n• cancers that have spread to the pituitary gland (most\\ncommonly occurring with breast cancer)\\n• sarcoidosis (or other related disorders), causing\\ndestruction of the pituitary gland\\n• any condition or illness that causes decreased oxygen\\ndelivery to the brain\\n• the use of certain medications that decrease ADH produc-\\ntion (like the antiseizure drug phenytoin)\\n• the excessive use of alcohol\\nCentral DI may also occur in women who are preg-\\nnant or have just given birth, and in patients with AIDS\\nwho have suffered certain types of brain infections.\\nNephrogenic DI sometimes occurs in patients who are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1046\\nDiabetes insipidus'),\n",

Symptoms include frequent urination, lethargy,\\nexcessive thirst, and hunger. The treatment includes\\nchanges in diet, oral medications, and in some cases,\\ndaily injections of insulin.\\nDescription\\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes\\nserious health complications including renal (kidney)\\nfailure, heart disease,stroke, and blindness. Approxi-\\nmately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula-\\ntion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-half\\nare unaware that they have it.\\nBackground\\nEvery cell in the human body needs energy in order\\nto function. The body’s primary energy source is glu-\\ncose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of\\nfoods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).\\nGlucose from the digested food circulates in the blood\\nas a ready energy source for any cells that need it.\\nInsulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in\\nthe pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.\\nInsulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and\\nacts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through\\nwhich glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be\\nconverted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen\\nor fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not\\nenough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer\\nrecognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood\\nrather entering the cells.\\nThe body will attempt to dilute the high level of\\nglucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia,\\nby drawing water out of the cells and into the blood-\\nstream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in\\nthe urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed\\ndiabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of\\nwater, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid\\nof the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose\\nin the urine.\\nAt the same time that the body is trying to get rid\\nof glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu-\\ncose and sending signals to the body to eat more food,\\nthus making patients extremely hungry. To provide\\nenergy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con-\\nvert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats\\nand proteins for energy causes acid compounds called\\nketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be\\nexcreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood,\\na condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi-\\ntion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading to\\ncomaand death.\\nTypes of diabetes mellitus\\nType I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes,\\nbegins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In\\nthis form of diabetes, the body produces little or no\\ninsulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs\\nmore frequently in populations descended from Northern\\nEuropean countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) than\\nin those from Southern European countries, the Middle\\nEast, or Asia. In the United States, approximately three\\npeople in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is also\\ncalled insulin-dependent diabetes because people who\\ndevelop this type need to have daily injections of insulin.\\nBrittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where\\npatients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugar\\nlevels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there is\\ntoo much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo-\\nglycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev-\\nels of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients may\\nrequire several injections of different types of insulin\\nduring the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair-\\nly normal range.\\nThe more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs\\nin approximately 3–5% of Americans under 50 years of\\nage, and increases to 10–15% in those over 50. More\\nthan 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type II\\ndiabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia-\\nbetes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in people\\nwho are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also\\nmore common in people of Native American, Hispanic,\\nand African-American descent. People who have migrat-\\ned to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus-\\ntralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel-\\nop Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi-\\nnal countries.\\nType II is considered a milder form of diabetes\\nbecause of its slow onset (sometimes developing over the\\ncourse of several years) and because it can usually be\\ncontrolled with diet and oral medication. The conse-\\nquences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes,\\nhowever, are the just as serious as those for Type I. This\\nform is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a term\\nthat is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type II\\ndiabetes can control the condition with diet and oral\\nmedications, however, insulin injections are sometimes\\nnecessary if treatment with diet and oral medication is\\nnot working.\\nAnother form of diabetes called gestational dia-\\nbetes can develop during pregnancy and generally\\nresolves after the baby is delivered.

These women who have diabetes during\\npregnancy are at higher risk for developing Type II dia-\\nbetes within 5–10 years.\\nDiabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic\\ndisease, alcoholism , malnutrition , or other severe ill-\\nnesses that stress the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev-\\ner, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors\\npassed on in families) and environmental factors\\ninvolved. Research has shown that some people who\\ndevelop diabetes have common genetic markers. In Type\\nI diabetes, the immune system, the body’s defense sys-\\ntem against infection, is believed to be triggered by a\\nvirus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in the\\npancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age,\\nobesity, and family history of diabetes play a roll.\\nIn Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce\\nenough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to\\nthe insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.\\nSymptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that\\na person may not know that they have it. Early signs are\\nlethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other\\nsymptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound\\nhealing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred\\nvision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect-\\ned while a patient is seeing a doctor about another health\\nconcern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag-\\nnosed diabetes.\\nIndividuals who are at high risk of developing Type\\nII diabetes mellitus include people who:\\n• are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body\\nweight)\\n• have a relative with diabetes mellitus\\n• belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer-\\nican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian)\\n• have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have\\ndelivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg)\\n• have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above)\\n• have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less\\nthan or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride level\\ngreater than or equal to 250 mg/dL\\n• have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast-\\ning glucose on previous testing\\nSeveral common medications can impair the body’s\\nuse of insulin, causing a condition known as secondary\\ndiabetes. These medications include treatments for high\\nblood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide\\ndiuretics), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra-\\nceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti-\\ncorids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin.\\nSeveral drugs that are used to treat mood disorders\\n(such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose\\nabsorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car-\\nbonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and\\nadrenergic agonists. Other medications that can cause\\ndiabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid,\\ncimetidine, and heparin.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over\\ndays or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-\\ncents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in\\noverweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-\\ntoms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,\\nexcessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.\\nKetoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or\\nuncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes.\\nKetones are acid compounds that form in the blood when\\nthe body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms\\ninclude abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing,\\nextreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci-\\ndosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated,\\nthis condition can lead to coma and death.\\nWith Type II diabetes, the condition may not become\\nevident until the patient presents for medical treatment for\\nsome other condition.

Blood is drawn from a vein\\nin the patient’s arm after a period at least eight hours when\\nthe patient has not eaten, usually in the morning before\\nbreakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam-\\nple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain-\\ning plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) or\\ngreater can indicate diabetes.

A\\nsmall needle or lancet is used to prick the finger and a\\ndrop of blood is collected and analyzed by a monitoring\\ndevice. Some patients may test their blood glucose levels\\nseveral times during a day and use this information to\\nadjust their doses of insulin.\\nTreatment\\nThere is currently no cure for diabetes; the condi-\\ntion, however, can be managed so that patients can live a\\nrelatively normal life. Treatment of diabetes focuses on\\ntwo goals: keeping blood glucose within normal range\\nand preventing the development of long-term complica-\\ntions. Careful monitoring of diet, exercise, and blood\\nglucose levels are as important as the use of insulin or\\noral medications in preventing complications of diabetes.\\nDietary changes\\nDiet and moderate exercise are the first treatments\\nimplemented in diabetes. For many Type II diabetics,\\nweight loss may be an important goal in helping them to\\ncontrol their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet pro-\\nvides approximately 50–60% of calories from carbohy-\\ndrates, approximately 10–20% of calories from protein,\\nand less than 30% of calories from fat. The number of\\ncalories required by an individual depends on their age,\\nweight, and activity level. The calorie intake also needs to\\nbe distributed over the course of the entire day so surges of\\nglucose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum.\\nKeeping track of the number of calories provided by\\ndifferent foods can become complicated, so patients are\\nusually advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. An\\nindividualized, easy to manage diet plan can be set up for\\neach patient. Both the American Diabetes Association and\\nthe American Dietetic Association recommend diets based\\non the use of food exchange lists. Each food exchange\\ncontains a known amount of calories in the form of pro-\\ntein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient’s diet plan will consist\\nof a certain number of exchanges from each food category\\n(meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches, vegetables,\\nand fats) to be eaten at meal times and as snacks. Patients\\nhave flexibility in choosing which foods they eat as long\\nas they stick with the number of exchanges prescribed.\\nFor many Type II diabetics, weight loss is an impor-\\ntant factor in controlling their condition. The food\\nexchange system, along with a plan of moderate exer-\\ncise, can help them lose excess weight and improve their\\noverall health.\\nOral medications\\nOral medications are available to lower blood glucose\\nin Type II diabetics. The drugs first prescribed for Type II\\ndiabetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureas\\nand include tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, and\\nchlorpropamide. Newer drugs in the same class are now\\navailable and include glyburide, glimeperide, and glip-\\nizide. The way that these drugs work is not well under-\\nstood, however, they seem to stimulate cells of the pan-\\ncreas to produce more insulin. New medications that are\\navailable to treat diabetes include metformin, acarbose,\\nand troglitizone. The choice of the right medication\\ndepends in part on the individual patient profile. All drugs\\nhave side effects that may make them inappropriate for\\nparticular patients. Some for example, may stimulate\\nweight gain or cause stomach irritation, so they may not be\\nthe best treatment for someone who is already overweight\\nor who also has stomach ulcers. While these medications\\nare an important aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes,\\nthey are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder-\\nate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for Type I\\ndiabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin.\\nInsulin\\nPatients with Type I diabetes need daily injections of\\ninsulin to help their bodies use glucose. The amount and\\ntype of insulin required depends on the height, weight,\\nage, food intake, and activity level of the individual dia-\\nbetic patient. Some patients with Type II diabetes may\\nneed to use insulin injections if their diabetes cannot be\\ncontrolled with diet, exercise, and oral medication. Injec-\\ntions are given subcutaneously, that is, just under the\\nskin, using a small needle and syringe. Injection sites can\\nbe anywhere on the body where there is looser skin,\\nincluding the upper arm, abdomen, or upper thigh.\\nPurified human insulin is most commonly used,\\nhowever, insulin from beef and pork sources are also\\navailable. Insulin may be given as an injection of a single\\ndose of one type of insulin once a day. Different types of\\ninsulin can be mixed and given in one dose or split into\\ntwo or more doses during a day. Patients who require\\nmultiple injections over the course of a day may be able\\nto use an insulin pump that administers small doses of\\ninsulin on demand. The small battery-operated pump is\\nworn outside the body and is connected to a needle that is\\ninserted into the abdomen. Pumps can be programmed to\\ninject small doses of insulin at various times during the\\nday, or the patient may be able to adjust the insulin doses\\nto coincide with meals and exercise.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1051\\nDiabetes mellitus'),\n",

Eye problems including cataracts , glau-\\ncoma, and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in\\ndiabetics.\\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition\\nwhere nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feet\\nbecome less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic-\\nular problem since the patient does not feel the pain of\\na blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir-\\nculation in the legs and feet contribute to delayed\\nwound healing. The inability to sense pain along with\\nthe complications of delayed wound healing can result\\nin minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becoming\\ninfected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec-\\ntion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rot\\naway. The most serious consequence of this condition\\nis the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to\\nsevere infection.\\nHeart disease and kidney disease are common com-\\nplications of diabetes.

Because a person\\nwho has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort,\\nproblems can remain undetected until fever, weakness, or\\nother signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, even\\nminor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, and\\nare more likely to result in serious health problems.\\nWith diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently\\nbecause the disease causes nervous system changes and\\npoor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat-\\ning no longer work, the skin of the feet can become very\\ndry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre-\\nquently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly,\\nthese calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Because\\ndiabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu-\\nropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcer\\ncan quickly become infected and, if not treated, may\\nresult in the death of tissue (gangrene) or amputation.\\nThe risk of infection is greatest for people who are\\nover the age of 60 and for those who have one or more of\\nthe following:\\n• poorly controlled diabetes\\n• foot ulcers\\n• laser treatment for changes in the retina\\n• kidney or vascular disease\\n• loss of sensation (neuropathy)\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBacteria can cause an infection through small cracks\\n(fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heel\\nand on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses,\\nblisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterial\\ninfection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spread\\nthroughout the body.\\nCommon sites of diabetic foot infections include the\\nfollowing:\\n• blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin\\n• bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the\\nbones of the foot\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1053\\nDiabetic foot infections'),\n",

Insulin is the hormone secret-\\ned by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when\\nthey become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease\\nresulting from the inability of the body to produce or\\nrespond properly to insulin, required by the body to\\nconvert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA\\ncomplications represent the leading cause of death ,\\nmostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large\\namounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA\\ncombines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean-\\ning excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone-\\nmia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the\\nbody; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become\\ntoo acidic.\\nInsulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi-\\ntions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most\\ncells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without\\nthe presence of insulin; this condition makes the body\\nuse stored fat as an alternative source instead of the\\nunavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces\\nacidic ketones, which build up because they require\\ninsulin to be broken down. The presence of excess\\nketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to\\nbecome more acidic than the body tissues, which creates\\na toxic condition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDKA is most commonly seen in individuals with\\ntype I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually\\ncaused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or\\nby acute infection or trauma. A small number of people\\nwith type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but\\nthis is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro-\\nduce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type\\nII patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food\\nintake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper-\\nglycemia.\\nSome common DKA symptoms include:\\n• high blood sugar levels\\n• frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst\\n• fatigue and lethargy\\n• nausea\\n• vomiting\\n• abdominal pain\\n• fruity odor to breath\\n• rapid, deep breathing\\n• muscle stiffness or aching\\n•coma\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper-\\nglycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab-\\nlished if the patient’s urine or blood is strongly positive\\nfor glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non-\\ndiabetic person on average range from 80–110 mg/dl. A\\nperson with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside\\nthose parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl\\nand can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon-\\nate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present,\\nindicative of acidosis.\\nA blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine\\nthe concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test\\nstrips are available to patients commercially can sub-\\nmerge in urine to detect the presence or concentration\\nof ketones.\\nTreatment\\nKetoacidosis is treated under medical supervision\\nand usually in a hospital setting.\\nBasic treatment includes:\\n• administering insulin to correct the hyperglycemia and\\nhyperketonemia\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1055\\nDiabetic ketoacidosis'),\n",

Diabetic neuropathy may be diffuse,\\naffecting several parts of the body, or focal, affecting a\\nspecific nerve and part of the body.\\nDescription\\nThe nervous system consists of two major divisions:\\nthe central nervous systems (CNS) which includes the\\nbrain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and the\\nperipheral nervous system (PNS) which includes the\\nnerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus-\\ncles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph-\\neral nerves are either motor, meaning that they are\\ninvolved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory,\\nmeaning that they carry sensory information back to the\\nCNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulate\\ninvoluntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing,\\nheartbeat, blood pressure, etc.\\nThere are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy\\nthat affect different nervous system functions. Diffuse\\nperipheral neuropathyprimarily affects the limbs, dam-\\naging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu-\\nropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and it\\naffects the heart and other internal organs.\\nFocal—or localized—diabetic neuropathy affects\\nspecific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head.\\nDiabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness,\\nloss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func-\\ntions such as digestion, erection, bladder control and\\nsweating among others.\\nThe longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the\\ndevelopment of one or more forms of neuropathy.\\nApproximately 60–70% of patients with diabetes have\\nneuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painful\\nsymptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not\\nknown. Researchers believe that the process of nerve\\ndamage is related to high glucose concentrations in the\\nblood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis-\\nrupting their ability to effectively send messages. High\\nblood glucose is also known to damage the blood vessels\\nthat carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. In\\naddition, some people may have a genetic predisposition\\nto develop neuropathy.\\nThere is a wide range of symptoms associated with\\ndiabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nerves\\nand parts of the body affected and also on the type of\\nneuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp-\\ntoms, while others are severely disabled.\\nCommon symptoms of diffuse peripheral neuropa-\\nthy include:\\n• numbness and feelings of tingling or burning\\n• insensitivity to pain\\n• needle-like jabs of pain\\n• extreme sensitivity to touch\\n• loss of balance and coordination\\nCommon symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa-\\nthy include:\\n• impaired urination and sexual function\\n• bladder infections\\n• stomach disorders, due to the impaired ability of the\\nstomach to empty (gastric stasis)\\n• nausea, vomiting, bloating\\n• dizziness, lightheadedness,fainting spells\\n• loss of appetite\\nCommon symptoms of focal neuropathy include:\\n• pain in the front of a thigh\\n• severe pain in the lower back\\n• pain in the chest or stomach\\n• ache behind an eye\\n• double vision\\n• paralysis on one side of the face\\nIn severe diabetic neuropathy loss of sensation can\\nlead to injuries that are unnoticed, progressing to infec-\\ntions, ulceration, and possibly amputation.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of neuropathy is based on the symp-\\ntoms that present during a physical exam. Pain assess-\\nment is usually the first step. Patients may have more\\nthan one type of pain, and the history helps the doctor\\ndetermine whether a the pain has a neuropathic cause.\\nThe exam may include:\\n• a screening test for lost sensation\\n• nerve conduction studies to check the flow of electric\\ncurrent through a nerve\\n• electromyography (EMG) to see how well muscles\\nrespond to electrical impulses transmitted by nearby\\nnerves.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1057\\nDiabetic neuropathy'),\n",

While the treatment prescription and regi-\\nmen is usually overseen by a nephrologist (a doctor that\\nspecializes in the kidney), dialysis treatments are typical-\\nly administered by a nurse or patient care technician in\\noutpatient clinics known as dialysis centers, or in hospi-\\ntal-based dialysis units. In-home hemodialysis treatment\\nis also an option for some patients, although access to\\nthis type of treatment may be limited by financial and\\nlifestyle factors. An investment in equipment is required\\nand another person in the household should be available\\nfor support and assistance with treatments.\\nPeritoneal dialysis\\nIn peritoneal dialysis, the patient’s peritoneum, or lin-\\ning of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter is sur-\\ngically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treat-\\nment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity with\\ndialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from the\\npatient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solution. After a\\nwaiting period of six to 24 hours, depending on the treat-\\nment method used, the waste-filled dialysate is drained\\nfrom the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate.\\nThere are three types of peritoneal dialysis:\\n• Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A\\ncontinuous treatment that is self-administered and\\nrequires no machine. The patient inserts fresh dialysate\\nsolution into the abdominal cavity, waits four to six\\nhours, and removes the used solution. The solution is\\nimmediately replaced with fresh dialysate. A bag\\nattached to the catheter is worn under clothing.\\n• Continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). An\\novernight treatment that uses a machine to drain and\\nrefill the abdominal cavity, CCPD takes 10–12 hours\\nper session.\\n• Intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). This hospital-\\nbased treatment is performed several times a week. A\\nmachine administers and drains the dialysate solution,\\nand sessions can take up to 24 hours.\\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the treatment option of\\nchoice in infants and children, whose small size can\\nmake vascular (through a vein) access difficult to main-\\ntain.

One of the primary\\ncauses of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skin\\ncontact with wetness. Under these circumstances, natural\\noils are stripped away, the outer layer of skin is damaged,\\nand there is increased susceptibility to infection by bacte-\\nria or yeast.\\nDiaper rash is a term that covers a broad variety of\\nskin conditions that occur on the same area of the body.\\nSome babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFrequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-\\ning of the diaper against tender skin, initiating a friction\\nrash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It may\\nbe more pronounced around the edges of the diaper, at\\nthe waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’t\\nappear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes the\\nchemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributing\\nfactors and may result in contact dermatitis . These\\nrashes should clear up easily with proper attention.\\nIgnoring the condition may lead to a secondary infection\\nthat is more difficult to resolve.\\nFriction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the\\nbaby’s skin folds, called intertrigo. This rash appears as\\nreddened areas that may ooze and is often uncomfortable\\nwhen the diaper is wet. Intertrigo can also be found on\\nother areas of the body where there are deep skin folds\\nthat tend to trap moisture.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent\\nof cradle cap. It is scaly and greasy in appearance and\\nmay be worse in the folds of the skin.\\nYeast, or candidal dermatitis, is the most common\\ninfectious cause of diaper rash. The affected areas are\\nraised and quite red with distinct borders, and satellite\\nlesions may occur around the edges. Yeast is part of the\\nnormal skin flora, and is often an opportunistic invader\\nwhen simple diaper rash is untreated. It is particularly\\ncommon after treatment with antibiotics, which kill the\\ngood bacteria that normally keep the yeast population in\\ncheck. Usual treatments for diaper rash will not clear it up.\\nRepeated or difficult to resolve episodes of yeast infection\\nmay warrant further medical attention, since this is some-\\ntimes associated with diabetes or immune problems.\\nAnother infectious cause of diaper rash is impetigo.\\nThis bacterial infection is characterized by blisters that\\nooze and crust.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe presence of skin lesions in the diaper area\\nmeans that the baby has diaper rash. However, there are\\nseveral types of rash that may require specific treatment\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1062\\nDiaper rash'),\n",

It is useful to be able to distinguish them\\nby appearance as described above.\\nA baby with a rash that does not clear up within two\\nto three days or a rash with blisters or bleeding should be\\nseen by a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotics are generally prescribed for rashes\\ncaused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be a\\ntopical or oral formulation, depending on the size of the\\narea involved and the severity of the infection.\\nOver-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim-\\nin, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting from\\nyeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral antifun-\\ngal may be prescribed.\\nMild steroid creams, such as 0.5–1% hydrocorti-\\nsone, can be used for seborrheic dermatitis and some-\\ntimes intertrigo. Prescription strength creams may be\\nneeded for short-term treatment of more stubborn cases.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGood diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many\\nsimple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checked\\nvery frequently and changed as soon as they are wet or\\nsoiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthy\\nskin. Babies should have some time without wearing a\\ndiaper, and a waterproof pad can be used to protect the\\nbed or other surface. Rubber pants, or other occlusive fab-\\nrics, should not be used over the diaper area. Some cloth-\\nlike disposable diapers promote better air circulation than\\nplastic-type diapers. It may be necessary for mothers to\\nexperiment with diaper types to see if the baby’s skin\\nreacts better to cloth or disposable ones. If disposable dia-\\npers are used, the baby’s skin may react differently to var-\\nious brands. If the baby is wearing cloth diapers, they\\nshould be washed in a mild detergent and double rinsed.\\nThe diaper area should be cleaned with something\\nmild, even plain water. Some wipes contain alcohol or\\nchemicals that can be irritating for some babies. Plain\\nwater may be the best cleansing substance when there is\\na rash. Using warm water in a spray bottle (or giving a\\nquick bath) and then lightly patting the skin dry can pro-\\nduce less skin trauma than using wipes. In the event of\\nsuspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can be\\nadded to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansing\\nsolution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, but\\nacidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth.\\nBarrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes.\\nThose that contain zinc oxide are especially effective.\\nThese creams and ointments protect already irritated skin\\nfrom the additional insult of urine and stool, particularly\\nif the baby has diarrhea . Cornstarch powder may be\\nused on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo.\\nNutrition\\nWhat the baby eats can make a difference in stool fre-\\nquency and acidity. Typically, breast-fed babies will have\\nfewer problems with rashes. When adding a new food to\\nthe diet, the baby should be observed closely to see\\nwhether rashes are produced around the baby’s mouth or\\nanus. If this occurs, the new food should be discontinued.\\nBabies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to\\nget rashes due to yeast. To help bring the good bacterial\\ncounts back to normal,Lactobacillus bifidus can be\\nadded to the diet. It is available in powder form from\\nmost health food stores.\\nHerbal treatment\\nSome herbal preparations can be useful for diaper\\nrash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues,\\nand disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheic\\ndermatitis as well as for general inflammation of the\\nskin. The ointment should be applied at each diaper\\nchange. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing for\\nirritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily.\\nPrognosis\\nTreated appropriately, diaper rash will resolve fairly\\nquickly if there is no underlying health problem or skin\\ndisease.\\nPrevention\\nFrequent diaper changes are important to keep the\\nskin dry and healthy.

Since vaginas vary in size, each patient will\\nneed to be fitted by a doctor or nurse with a diaphragm\\nthat conforms to the shape and contour of the vagina as\\nwell as the strength of the muscles in the vaginal walls.\\nDiaphragms must be used with spermicidal cream or\\njelly. The device should cause no discomfort, and neither\\nthe woman nor her partner should feel that it is there.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of a diaphragm is to prevent access to\\nthe womb (uterus) by the sperm and thus prevent concep-\\ntion. The level of effectiveness is about 95%.\\nPrecautions\\nEach client will undergo a physical examinationand\\na Pap smear. If these are normal, the physician will fit the\\npatient for the device and give instructions on how to\\ninsert, remove, and clean the object. She will also be\\ntaught the signs and symptoms of potential complications.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.\\nDescription\\nPrior to insertion, the inside of the dome and the rim\\nare covered with a thick layer (perhaps a tablespoon) of a\\nspermicide that is compatible with the diaphragm being\\nused. The domed area covers the opening into the uterus\\n(cervix) and keeps the spermicide in place. As a result,\\nany sperm that might get under the diaphragm will be\\ndestroyed.\\nDiaphragms may be inserted two to three hours prior\\nto intercourse, and must be left in place for six to eight\\nhours following sexual relations. During this time the\\nwoman may not swim, bathe, or douche, but she may\\nshower. If she desires to have intercourse again before\\nthe six to eight hours have passed, the diaphragm should\\nnot be removed. Instead, an applicator full of spermicide\\nshould be deposited into the vagina.\\nA diaphragm will last for a year or more. It should\\nbe examined weekly for holes. This can be done by hold-\\ning it up to the light or filling it with water.\\nPreparation\\nBefore inserting the diaphragm, the woman should\\nempty her bladder and wash her hands with soap and\\nwater. The device should be checked for leaks by filling\\nit with water or holding it up to the light. A spermicidal\\njelly is then applied to the inside and outside, and espe-\\ncially around the rim. While standing with one foot ele-\\nvated on a chair or step, lying down, or squatting, the\\nwoman folds the diaphragm inward toward the middle\\nand inserts it into the vagina as far as it will go.\\nAftercare\\nWhen removed, the diaphragm should be washed\\nwith a mild soap and water. After being dried, it can be\\ndusted with corn starch before being returned to its con-\\ntainer. The diaphragm should always be stored away\\nfrom sunlight and heat in a cool, dry place. It should not\\nbe washed with harsh or perfumed soaps or used with\\nperfumed powders because either of these substances can\\ndamage the diaphragm.\\nRisks\\nAlthough rare, wearing the diaphragm longer than\\nthe recommended time can result in toxic shock syn-\\ndrome. The signs and symptoms of this serious illness\\ninclude sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea,\\ndizziness , faintness, weakness, aching muscles and\\njoints, and rash. The doctor must be notified immediately\\nif any of these conditions appear.

The symp-\\ntoms include high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\nDiarrhea\\nDefinition\\nTo most individuals, diarrhea means an increased\\nfrequency or decreased consistency of bowel move-\\nments; however, the medical definition is more exact\\nthan this. In many developed countries, the average num-\\nber of bowel movements is three per day. However,\\nresearchers have found that diarrhea best correlates with\\nan increase in stool weight; stool weights above 10 oz\\n(300 g) per day generally indicates diarrhea. This is\\nmainly due to excess water, which normally makes up\\n60–85% of fecal matter. In this way, true diarrhea is dis-\\ntinguished from diseases that cause only an increase in\\nthe number of bowel movements (hyperdefecation), or\\nincontinence (involuntary loss of bowel contents).\\nDiarrhea is also classified by physicians into acute,\\nwhich lasts one to two weeks, and chronic, which contin-\\nues for longer than 23 weeks. Viral and bacterial infec-\\ntions are the most common causes of acute diarrhea.\\nDescription\\nIn many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,\\nlimited annoyance. However, worldwide acute infectious\\ndiarrhea has a huge impact, causing over five million\\ndeaths per year. While most deaths are among children\\nunder five years of age in developing nations, the impact,\\neven in developed countries, is considerable. For exam-\\nple, over 250,000 individuals are admitted to hospitals in\\nthe United States each year because of one of these\\nepisodes. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatment can pre-\\nvent much of the suffering associated with these devas-\\ntating illnesses.\\nChronic diarrhea also has a considerable effect on\\nhealth, as well as on social and economic well being.\\nPatients with celiac disease , inflammatory bowel dis-\\nease, and other prolonged diarrheal illnesses develop\\nnutritional deficiencies that diminish growth and immu-\\nnity. They affect social interaction and result in the loss\\nof many working hours.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDiarrhea occurs because more fluid passes through\\nthe large intestine (colon) than that organ can absorb. As\\na rule, the colon can absorb several times more fluid than\\nis required on a daily basis. However, when this reserve\\ncapacity is overwhelmed, diarrhea occurs.\\nDiarrhea is caused by infections or illnesses that\\neither lead to excess production of fluids or prevent\\nabsorption of fluids.

In addition, rapid passage\\nof material through the colon can also do the same.\\nSymptoms related to any diarrheal illness are often\\nthose associated with any injury to the gastrointestinal\\ntract, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal\\npain. All or none of these may be present depending on\\nthe disease causing the diarrhea. The number of bowel\\nmovements can vary—up to 20 or more per day. In some\\npatients, blood or pus is present in the stool. Bowel\\nmovements may be difficult to flush (float) or contain\\nundigested food material.\\nThe most common causes of acute diarrhea are\\ninfections (the cause of traveler’s diarrhea ), food\\npoisoning , and medications. Medications are a fre-\\nquent and often over-looked cause, especially antibi-\\notics and antacids . Less often, various sugar free\\nfoods, which sometimes contain poorly absorbable\\nmaterials, cause diarrhea.\\nChronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the\\nsame things that cause the shorter episodes (infections,\\nmedications, etc.); symptoms just last longer. Some\\ninfections can become chronic. This occurs mainly with\\nparasitic infections (such as Giardia) or when patients\\nhave altered immunity (AIDS).\\nThe following are the more usual causes of chronic\\ndiarrhea:\\n• AIDS\\n• colon cancer and other bowel tumors\\n• endocrine or hormonal abnormalities (thyroid, diabetes\\nmellitus, etc.)\\n• food allergy\\n• inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and\\nulcerative colitis)\\n• lactose intolerance\\n• malabsorption syndromes (celiac and Whipple’s dis-\\nease)\\n• other (alcohol, microscopic colitis, radiation, surgery)\\nComplications\\nThe major effects of diarrhea are dehydration, mal-\\nnutrition, and weight loss. Signs of dehydration can be\\nhard to notice, but increasing thirst, dry mouth , weak-\\nness or lightheadedness (particularly if worsening on\\nstanding), or a darkening/decrease in urination are sug-\\ngestive. Severe dehydration leads to changes in the\\nbody’s chemistry and could become life-threatening.\\nDehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney failure,\\nneurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost cases of acute diarrhea never need diagnosis or\\ntreatment, as many are mild and produce few problems.\\nBut patients with fever over 102°F (38.9°C), signs of\\ndehydration, bloody bowel movements, severe abdomi-\\nnal pain, known immune disease, or prior use of antibi-\\notics need prompt medical evaluation.\\nWhen diagnostic studies are needed, the most use-\\nful are stool culture and examination for parasites;\\nhowever these are often negative and a cause cannot be\\nfound in a large number of patients. The earlier cul-\\ntures are performed, the greater the chance of obtain-\\ning a positive result. For those with a history of antibi-\\notic use in the preceding two months, stool samples\\nneed to be examined for the toxins that cause antibiot-\\nic-associated colitis . Tests are also available to check\\nstool samples for microscopic amounts of blood and\\nfor cells that indicate severe inflammation of the colon.\\nExamination with an endoscope is sometimes helpful\\nin determining severity and extent of inflammation.\\nTests to check changes in blood chemistry (potassium,\\nmagnesium, etc.) and a complete blood count (CBC)\\nare also often performed.\\nChronic diarrhea is quite different, and most patients\\nwith this condition will receive some degree of testing.\\nMany exams are the same as for an acute episode, as\\nsome infections and parasites cause both types of diar-\\nrhea. A careful history to evaluate medication use,\\ndietary changes, family history of illnesses, and other\\nsymptoms is necessary. Key points in determining the\\nseriousness of symptoms are weight loss of over 10 lb\\n(4.5 kg), blood in the stool, and nocturnal diarrhea\\n(symptoms that awaken the patient from sleep).\\nBoth prescription and over-the-counter medications\\ncan contain additives, such as lactose and sorbitol, that\\nwill produce diarrhea in sensitive individuals. Review of\\nallergiesor skin changes may also point to a cause.\\nSocial history may indicate if stress is playing a role or\\nidentify activities which can be associated with diarrhea\\n(for example, diarrhea that occurs in runners).\\nA combination of stool, blood, and urine tests may\\nbe needed in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea; in addi-\\ntion a number of endoscopic and x-ray studies are fre-\\nquently required.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is ideally directed toward correcting the\\ncause; however, the first aim should be to prevent or treat\\ndehydration and nutritional deficiencies.

For example, the bulk agent psylli-\\num helps some patients by absorbing excess fluid and\\nsolidifying stools; cholestyramine, which binds bile\\nacids, is effective in treating bile salt induced diarrhea.\\nLow fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in\\nsome patients. New antidiarrheal drugs that decrease\\nexcessive secretion of fluid by the intestinal tract is\\nanother approach for some diseases.

For example, Judaism has\\nincluded numerous dietary restrictions for thousands\\nof years. One ancient Jewish sect, the Essenes, is said\\nto have developed a primitive detoxification diet\\naimed at preparing the bodies, minds, and spirits of its\\nmembers for the coming of a “messiah” who would\\ndeliver them from their Roman captors. Preventative\\nand therapeutic diets became quite popular during the\\nlate twentieth century. Books promoting the latest\\ndietary plan continue to make the bestseller lists,\\nalthough not all of the information given is considered\\nauthoritative.\\nThe idea of a healthful diet is to provide all of the\\ncalories and nutrients needed by the body for optimal\\nperformance, at the same time ensuring that neither\\nnutritional deficiencies nor excesses occur. Diet plans\\nthat claim to accomplish those objectives are so numer-\\nous they are virtually uncountable. These diets employ a\\nvariety of approaches, including the following:\\n• Fixed-menu: Offers little choice to the dieter. Specifies\\nexactly which foods will be consumed. Easy to follow,\\nbut may be considered “boring” to some dieters.\\n• Formula: Replaces some or all meals with a nutritional-\\nly balanced liquid formula or powder.\\n• Exchange-type: Allows the dieter to choose between\\nselected foods from each food group.\\n• Flexible: Doesn’t concern itself with the overall diet,\\nsimply with one aspect such as fat or energy.\\nDiets may also be classified according to the types\\nof foods they allow. For example, an omnivorous diet\\nconsists of both animal and plant foods, whereas a lacto-\\novo-vegetarian diet permits no animal flesh, but does\\ninclude eggs, milk, and dairy products. A vegan diet is a\\nstricter form of vegetarianism in which eggs, cheese,\\nand other milk products are prohibited.\\nA third way of classifying diets is according to their\\npurpose: religious, weight-loss, detoxification, lifestyle-\\nrelated, or aimed at prevention or treatment of a specific\\ndisease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1069\\nDiets\\nFats, oils, sweets\\n(use sparingly)\\nMilk, yogurt, cheese\\n(2–3 servings\\nper day)\\nVegetables\\n(3–5 servings \\nper day)\\nBread, rice, cereal, pasta\\n(6–11 servings per day)\\nMeat, poultry, fish,\\neggs, beans, nuts\\n(2–3) servings per day)\\nFruits\\n(2–4 servings \\nper day)\\nCereal\\nBread\\nMILK\\nSuggested daily food servings.

Young children need extra fat to\\nmaintain their active, growing bodies. Fat intake may be\\ngradually reduced between the ages of two and five, after\\nwhich it should be limited to a maximum of 30% of total\\ncalories through adulthood. Saturated fat should be\\nrestricted to no more than 10% of total calories.\\nWeight-loss dieters should be wary of the “yo-yo”\\neffect that occurs when numerous attempts are made to\\nreduce weight using high-risk, quick-fix diets.

The name corkscrew esophagus describes\\nperfectly the appearance of this disorder on x rays.\\nX rays may reveal a slightly different appearance\\nand result in the designation rosary bead esophagus, but\\nthe cause is still diffuse spasm, and the two entities\\nbehave in the same way.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause appears to be disruption of the complex\\nsystem of nerves that coordinates the muscular activity.\\nThe result is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and pain\\nthat feels like a heart attack and can involve the entire\\nchest, jaw, and arms.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21070\\nDiffuse esophageal spasm'),\n",

In the x ray department, the patient is given a\\ncontrast agent to drink. During swallowing, x rays record\\nthe passage of the agent down the esophagus and into the\\nstomach.

The\\nsyndrome is marked by absence or underdevelopment of\\nthe thymus and parathyroid glands. It is named for the\\npediatrician who first described it in 1965.\\nDescription\\nThe prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is debated;\\nthe estimates range from 1:4000 to 1:6395. Because\\nthe symptoms caused by the chromosomal abnormality\\nvary somewhat from patient to patient, the syndrome\\nprobably occurs much more often than was previously\\nthought. DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes described\\nas one of the “CATCH 22” disorders, so named\\nbecause of their characteristics—cardiac defects,\\nabnormal facial features, thymus underdevelopment,\\ncleft palate, and hypocalcemia—caused by a deletion\\nof several genes in chromosome 22. The specific facial\\nfeatures associated with DiGeorge syndrome include\\nlow-set ears, wide-set eyes, a small jaw, and a short\\ngroove in the upper lip. The male/female ratio is 1:1.\\nThe syndrome appears to be equally common in all\\nracial and ethnic groups.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDiGeorge syndrome is caused either by inheritance\\nof a defective chromosome 22 or by a new defect in chro-\\nmosome 22 in the fetus. The type of defect that is\\ninvolved is called deletion. A deletion occurs when the\\ngenetic material in the chromosomes does not recombine\\nproperly during the formation of sperm or egg cells. The\\ndeletion means that several genes from chromosome 22\\nare missing in DiGeorge syndrome patients. According\\nto a 1999 study, 6% of children with DiGeorge syndrome\\ninherited the deletion from a parent, while 94% had a\\nnew deletion.

This developmental failure results in a completely or\\npartially absent thymus gland and parathyroid glands. In\\naddition, 74% of fetuses with DiGeorge syndrome have\\nsevere heart defects. The child is born with a defective\\nimmune system and an abnormally low level of calcium\\nin the blood.\\nThese defects usually become apparent within 48\\nhours of birth. The infant’s heart defects may lead to heart\\nfailure, or there may be seizures and other evidence of a\\nlow level of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia).\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome can be made by\\nultrasound examination around the eighteenth week of\\npregnancy, when abnormalities in the development of the\\nheart or the palate can be detected. Another technique\\nthat is used to diagnose the syndrome before birth is\\ncalled fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH. This\\ntechnique uses DNA probes from the DiGeorge region\\non chromosome 22. FISH can be performed on cell sam-\\nples obtained by amniocentesis as early as the fourteenth\\nweek of pregnancy. It confirms about 95% of cases of\\nDiGeorge syndrome.\\nIf the mother has not had prenatal testing, the diag-\\nnosis of DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes suggested by\\nthe child’s facial features at birth. In other cases, the doc-\\ntor makes the diagnosis during heart surgery when he or\\nshe notices the absence or abnormal location of the thy-\\nmus gland. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood\\ntests for calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone\\nlevels, and by the sheep cell test for immune function.\\nTreatment\\nHypocalcemia\\nHypocalcemia in DiGeorge patients is unusually dif-\\nficult to treat. Infants are usually given calcium and vita-\\nmin D by mouth. Severe cases have been treated by\\ntransplantation of fetal thymus tissue or bone marrow.\\nHeart defects\\nInfants with life-threatening heart defects are treated\\nsurgically.\\nDefective immune function\\nChildren with DiGeorge syndrome should be kept\\non low-phosphorus diets and kept away from crowds or\\nother sources of infection. They should not be immu-\\nnized with vaccines made from live viruses or given cor-\\nticosteroids.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis is variable; many infants with DiGe-\\norge syndrome die from overwhelming infection,\\nseizures, or heart failure within the first year. Advances\\nin heart surgery indicate that the prognosis is most close-\\nly linked to the severity of the heart defects and the par-\\ntial presence of the thymus gland. In most children who\\nsurvive, the number of T cells, a type of white blood cell,\\nin the blood rises spontaneously as they mature. Sur-\\nvivors are likely to be mentally retarded, however, and to\\nhave other developmental difficulties, including psychi-\\natric problems in later life.\\nPrevention\\nGenetic counselingis recommended for parents of\\nchildren with DiGeorge syndrome because the disorder\\ncan be detected prior to birth. Although most children\\nwith DiGeorge syndrome did not inherit the chromosome\\ndeletion from their parents, they have a 50% chance of\\npassing the deletion on to their own children.\\nBecause of the association between DiGeorge syn-\\ndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome, pregnant women\\nshould avoid drinking alcoholic beverages.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Common Multiple Congenital Anomaly Syndromes.” In\\nNeonatology: Management, Procedures, On-Call Prob-\\nlems, Diseases and Drugs, ed.

Its most striking feature is\\nthe formation of a grayish membrane covering the tonsils\\nand upper part of the throat.\\nDescription\\nLike many other upper respiratory diseases, diphthe-\\nria is most likely to break out during the winter months.\\nAt one time it was a major childhood killer, but it is now\\nrare in developed countries because of widespread\\nimmunization. Since 1988, all confirmed cases in the\\nUnited States have involved visitors or immigrants. In\\ncountries that do not have routine immunization against\\nthis infection, the mortality rate varies from 1.5–25%.\\nPersons who have not been immunized may get\\ndiphtheria at any age. The disease is spread most often by\\ndroplets from the coughing or sneezing of an infected\\nperson or carrier. The incubation period is two to seven\\ndays, with an average of three days. It is vital to seek\\nmedical help at once when diphtheria is suspected,\\nbecause treatment requires emergency measures for\\nadults as well as children.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of diphtheria are caused by toxins\\nproduced by the diphtheria bacillus, Corynebacterium\\ndiphtheriae (from the Greek for “rubber membrane”). In\\nfact, toxin production is related to infections of the bacil-\\nlus itself with a particular bacteria virus called a phage\\n(from bacteriophage; a virus that infects bacteria). The\\nintoxication destroys healthy tissue in the upper area of\\nthe throat around the tonsils, or in open wounds in the\\nskin. Fluid from the dying cells then coagulates to form\\nthe telltale gray or grayish green membrane. Inside the\\nmembrane, the bacteria produce an exotoxin, which is a\\npoisonous secretion that causes the life-threatening\\nsymptoms of diphtheria. The exotoxin is carried through-\\nout the body in the bloodstream, destroying healthy tis-\\nsue in other parts of the body.\\nThe most serious complications caused by the exo-\\ntoxin are inflammations of the heart muscle ( myocardi-\\ntis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri-\\nous complications is increased as the time between onset\\nof symptoms and the administration of antitoxin increas-\\nes, and as the size of the membrane formed increases.\\nThe myocarditis may cause disturbances in the heart\\nrhythm and may culminate in heart failure . The symp-\\ntoms of nervous system involvement can include seeing\\ndouble (diplopia), painful or difficult swallowing, and\\nslurred speech or loss of voice, which are all indications\\nof the exotoxin’s effect on nerve functions. The exotoxin\\nmay also cause severe swelling in the neck (“bull neck”).\\nThe signs and symptoms of diphtheria vary accord-\\ning to the location of the infection:\\nNasal\\nNasal diphtheria produces few symptoms other than\\na watery or bloody discharge. On examination, there may\\nbe a small visible membrane in the nasal passages. Nasal\\ninfection rarely causes complications by itself, but it is a\\npublic health problem because it spreads the disease\\nmore rapidly than other forms of diphtheria.\\nPharyngeal\\nPharyngeal diphtheria gets its name from the phar-\\nynx, which is the part of the upper throat that connects\\nthe mouth and nasal passages with the voice box. This is\\nthe most common form of diphtheria, causing the charac-\\nteristic throat membrane. The membrane often bleeds if\\nit is scraped or cut. It is important not to try to remove\\nthe membrane because the trauma may increase the\\nbody’s absorption of the exotoxin. Other signs and symp-\\ntoms of pharyngeal diphtheria include mild sore throat,\\nfever of 101–102°F (38.3–38.9°C), a rapid pulse, and\\ngeneral body weakness.\\nLaryngeal\\nLaryngeal diphtheria, which involves the voice box\\nor larynx, is the form most likely to produce serious\\ncomplications. The fever is usually higher in this form of\\ndiphtheria (103–104°F or 39.4–40°C) and the patient is\\nvery weak. Patients may have a severe cough, have diffi-\\nculty breathing, or lose their voice completely. The\\ndevelopment of a “bull neck” indicates a high level of\\nexotoxin in the bloodstream. Obstruction of the airway\\nmay result in respiratory compromise and death.\\nSkin\\nThis form of diphtheria, which is sometimes called\\ncutaneous diphtheria, accounts for about 33% of diphthe-\\nria cases. It is found chiefly among people with poor\\nhygiene. Any break in the skin can become infected with\\ndiphtheria. The infected tissue develops an ulcerated area\\nand a diphtheria membrane may form over the wound but\\nis not always present. The wound or ulcer is slow to heal\\nand may be numb or insensitive when touched.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause diphtheria must be treated as quickly as\\npossible, doctors usually make the diagnosis on the basis\\nof the visible symptoms without waiting for test results.\\nIn making the diagnosis, the doctor examines the\\npatient’s eyes, ears, nose, and throat in order to rule out\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1077\\nDiphtheria'),\n",

The most important single symptom that sug-\\ngests diphtheria is the membrane. When a patient devel-\\nops skin infections during an outbreak of diphtheria, the\\ndoctor will consider the possibility of cutaneous diphthe-\\nria and take a smear to confirm the diagnosis.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by the\\nresults of a culture obtained from the infected area. Mater-\\nial from the swab is put on a microscope slide and stained\\nusing a procedure called Gram’s stain. The diphtheria\\nbacillus is called Gram-positive because it holds the dye\\nafter the slide is rinsed with alcohol. Under the micro-\\nscope, diphtheria bacilli look like beaded rod-shaped cells,\\ngrouped in patterns that resemble Chinese characters.\\nAnother laboratory test involves growing the diphtheria\\nbacillus on a special material called Loeffler’s medium.\\nTreatment\\nDiphtheria is a serious disease requiring hospital\\ntreatment in an intensive care unit if the patient has\\ndeveloped respiratory symptoms. Treatment includes a\\ncombination of medications and supportive care:\\nAntitoxin\\nThe most important step is prompt administration of\\ndiphtheria antitoxin, without waiting for laboratory\\nresults. The antitoxin is made from horse serum and\\nworks by neutralizing any circulating exotoxin. The doc-\\ntor must first test the patient for sensitivity to animal\\nserum. Patients who are sensitive (about 10%) must be\\ndesensitized with diluted antitoxin, since the antitoxin is\\nthe only specific substance that will counteract diphthe-\\nria exotoxin. No human antitoxin is available for the\\ntreatment of diphtheria.\\nThe dose ranges from 20,000–100,000 units,\\ndepending on the severity and length of time of symp-\\ntoms occurring before treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin is\\nusually given intravenously.\\nAntibiotics\\nAntibioticsare given to wipe out the bacteria, to\\nprevent the spread of the disease, and to protect the\\npatient from developing pneumonia. They are not a sub-\\nstitute for treatment with antitoxin. Both adults and chil-\\ndren may be given penicillin, ampicillin, or ery-\\nthromycin. Erythromycin appears to be more effective\\nthan penicillin in treating people who are carriers\\nbecause of better penetration into the infected area.\\nCutaneous diphtheria is usually treated by cleansing\\nthe wound thoroughly with soap and water, and giving\\nthe patient antibiotics for 10 days.\\nSupportive care\\nDiphtheria patients need bed rest with intensive\\nnursing care, including extra fluids, oxygenation, and\\nmonitoring for possible heart problems, airway blockage,\\nor involvement of the nervous system. Patients with\\nlaryngeal diphtheria are kept in a croup tent or high-\\nhumidity environment; they may also need throat suc-\\ntioning or emergency surgery if their airway is blocked.\\nPatients recovering from diphtheria should rest at\\nhome for a minimum of two to three weeks, especially if\\nthey have heart complications. In addition, patients\\nshould be immunized against diphtheria after recovery,\\nbecause having the disease does not always induce anti-\\ntoxin formation and protect them from reinfection.\\nPrevention of complications\\nDiphtheria patients who develop myocarditis may be\\ntreated with oxygen and with medications to prevent\\nirregular heart rhythms. An artificial pacemaker may be\\nneeded. Patients with difficulty swallowing can be fed\\nthrough a tube inserted into the stomach through the\\nnose. Patients who cannot breathe are usually put on\\nmechanical respirators.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis depends on the size and location of\\nthe membrane and on early treatment with antitoxin; the\\nlonger the delay, the higher the death rate. The most vul-\\nnerable patients are children under age 15 and those who\\ndevelop pneumonia or myocarditis. Nasal and cutaneous\\ndiphtheria are rarely fatal.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of diphtheria has four aspects:\\nImmunization\\nUniversal immunization is the most effective means\\nof preventing diphtheria. The standard course of immu-\\nnization for healthy children is three doses of DPT\\n(diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) preparation given between\\ntwo months and six months of age, with booster doses\\ngiven at 18 months and at entry into school. Adults\\nshould be immunized at 10 year intervals with Td\\n(tetanus-diphtheria) toxoid.

It is thought that\\nDLE (like SLE) may be an autoimmune disorder.\\nAutoimmune disordersare those that occur when cells\\nof the immune system are misdirected against the body.\\nNormally, immune cells work to recognize and help\\ndestroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\\nIn autoimmune disorders, these cells mistakenly recog-\\nnize various tissues of the body as foreign invaders, and\\nattack and destroy these tissues. In SLE, the misdirected\\nimmune cells are antibodies. In DLE, the damaging cells\\nare believed to be a type of white blood cell called a T\\nlymphocyte. The injury to the skin results in inflamma-\\ntion and the characteristic discoid lesions.\\nIn DLE, the characteristic skin lesion is circular and\\nraised. The reddish rash is about 5–10 mm in diameter,\\nwith the center often somewhat scaly and lighter in color\\nthan the darker outer ring. The surface of these lesions is\\nsometimes described as “warty.” There is rarely any itch-\\ning or pain associated with discoid lesions. They tend to\\nappear on the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, back, and\\narms. As DLE lesions heal, they leave thickened, scarred\\nareas of skin. When the scalp is severely affected, there\\nmay be associated hair loss (alopecia).\\nPeople with DLE tend to be quite sensitive to the\\nsun. They are more likely to get a sunburn, and the sun\\nis likely to worsen their discoid lesions.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of DLE usually requires a skin biopsy. A\\nsmall sample of a discoid lesion is removed, specially\\nprepared, and examined under a microscope. Usually, the\\nlesion has certain microscopic characteristics that allow it\\nto be identified as a DLE lesion. Blood tests will not\\nreveal the type of antibodies present in SLE, and physical\\nexamination usually does not reveal anything other than\\nthe skin lesions. If antibodies exist in the blood, or if other\\nsymptoms or physical signs are found, it is possible that\\nthe discoid lesions are a sign of SLE rather than DLE.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of DLE primarily involves the use of a\\nvariety of skin creams. Sunscreens are used for protec-\\ntion. Steroid creams can be applied to decrease inflamma-\\ntion. Occasionally, small amounts of a steroid preparation\\nwill be injected with a needle into a specific lesion.\\nBecause of their long list of side effects, steroid prepara-\\ntions taken by mouth are avoided. Sometimes, short-term\\ntreatment with oral steroids will be used for particularly\\nsevere DLE outbreaks. Medications used to treat the\\ninfectious disease malaria are often used to treat DLE.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for DLE include eating a\\nhealthy diet, low in red meat and dairy products and high\\nin fish containing omega-3 fatty acids. These types of\\nfish include mackerel, sardines, and salmon. Following a\\nhealthy diet is thought to decrease inflammation. Dietary\\nsupplements believed to be helpful include vitamins B,\\nC, E, and selenium. Vitamin A is also recommended to\\nimprove DLE lesions. Constitutional homeopathic treat-\\nment can help heal DLE as well as help prevent it devel-\\noping into SLE.\\nPrognosis\\nFor the most part, the prognosis for people with\\nDLE is excellent. While the lesions may be cosmetically\\nunsightly, they are not life threatening and usually do not\\ncause a patient to change his or her lifestyle. Only about\\n10% of patients with DLE will go on to develop SLE.\\nPrevention\\nDLE cannot be prevented. Recommendations to pre-\\nvent flares of DLE in patients with the disease include\\navoiding exposure to sun and consistently using sun-\\nscreen.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAaseng, Nathan.

Intervertebral disks act as\\nshockabsorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord\\nfrom the impact produced by the body’s movements.\\nPurpose\\nAbout 150,000 Americans undergo disk removal\\neach year in the United States. Removing the invertebral\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntibody —Specialized cells of the immune sys-\\ntem that can recognize organisms invading the\\nbody (like bacteria, viruses, and fungi). The anti-\\nbodies are then able to start a complex chain of\\nevents designed to kill these foreign invaders.\\nAutoimmune disorder—A disorder in which the\\nbody’s antibodies mistake the body’s own tissues\\nfor foreign invaders. The immune system then\\nattacks and causes damage to these tissues.\\nImmune system—The system of specialized organs,\\nlymph nodes, and blood cells throughout the body\\nthat work together to defend the body against for-\\neign invaders (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.).\\ndisk is performed to treat back pain that has lasted at least\\nsix weeks as a result of an abnormal disk and that has not\\nresponded to conservative treatment. Surgery is also per-\\nformed if there is pressure on the lumbosacral nerve roots\\nthat causes weakness or bowel or bladder disfunction.\\nAs a person ages, the disks between the vertebrae\\ndegenerate and dry out, and the fibers holding them in\\nplace tear. Eventually, the disk can form a blister-like\\nbulge, compressing nerves in the spine and causing pain.\\nThis is called a “prolapsed” (or herniated) disk. If such a\\ndisk causes muscle weakness or interferes with bladder\\nor bowel function because it is pressing on a nerve root,\\nimmediate surgery to remove the disk may be needed.\\nThe aim of the surgery is to try to relieve all pressure\\non nerve roots by removing the pulpy material from the\\ndisk, or the disk itself. If it is necessary to remove materi-\\nal from several nearby vertebrae, the spine may become\\nunsteady. In this case, the surgeon will perform a spinal\\nfusion, removing all the disks between two or more verte-\\nbrae and roughening the bones so that the vertebrae heal\\ntogether.

The ligaments and joint capsule are\\nrelatively strong and nonelastic but permit movement\\nwithin normal limits for each particular joint. In the event\\nof a dislocation, one of the bones making up the joint is\\nforced out of its natural alignment from excessive\\nstretching and tearing of the joint ligaments and capsule.\\nMuscles and tendons surrounding the joint are usually\\nstretched and injured to some degree.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA violent movement at the joint that exceeds normal\\nlimits usually causes a joint dislocation. Although dislo-\\ncations often result from trauma, they sometimes occur\\nas a result of disease affecting the joint structures. In the\\nprocess of the dislocation, there is tearing of the liga-\\nments and the articular capsule, which are vital structures\\nfor connecting the bone. Following a dislocation, the\\nbones affected are often immobile and the affected limb\\nmay be locked in an abnormal position; fractures are\\nalso a concern with severe dislocations.\\nImportant factors in recognizing a dislocation or\\nsubluxation include a history of experiencing a fall or\\nreceiving a blow in a particular joint followed by the sud-\\nden onset of loss of function to the involved limb. Imme-\\ndiately after the dislocation, the joint almost always\\nswells significantly and feels painful when pressure is\\napplied (point tenderness). If trauma to the joint causing\\nthe dislocation or subluxation is violent in nature, small\\nchips of bone can be torn away with the supporting struc-\\ntures. Chronic recurrent dislocations may take place\\nwithout severe pain because of the somewhat slack con-\\ndition of the surrounding muscles and other supporting\\ntissues. A first-time dislocation is considered and treated\\nas a possible fracture. Risk factors that can increase sus-\\nceptibility of joint dislocation and subluxation are shal-\\nlow or abnormally formed joint surfaces present at birth\\n(congenital) and/or other diseases of ligaments and tissue\\naround a joint. Some infants are born with a hip disloca-\\ntion. Both sexes and all ages are affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\\nphysician is the first step in the correct diagnosis of dis-\\nlocations and subluxations.

The treatment of realign-\\ning bones following a dislocation is called reduction.\\nThis may include simple maneuvers that manipulate the\\njoint to reposition the bones or surgical procedures to\\nrestore the joint to its normal position. A general anesthe-\\nsia or muscle relaxant may be used to help make joint\\nreduction possible by relaxing surrounding muscles in\\nspasm. Acetaminophen or aspirin are sometimes used\\nto control moderate pain, and narcotics may be pre-\\nscribed by the physician if the pain is severe.

Dissociation is a\\nmechanism that allows the mind to separate or compart-\\nmentalize certain memories or thoughts from normal\\nconsciousness. These split-off mental contents are not\\nerased. They may resurface spontaneously or be trig-\\ngered by objects or events in the person’s environment.\\nDissociation is a process that occurs along a spec-\\ntrum of severity. It does not necessarily mean that a per-\\nson has a dissociative disorder or other mental illness. A\\nmild degree of dissociation occurs with some physical\\nstressors; people who have gone without sleep for a long\\nperiod of time, have had “laughing gas” for dental\\nsurgery, or have been in a minor accident often have\\nbrief dissociative experiences. Another commonplace\\nexample of dissociation is a person becoming involved\\nin a book or movie so completely that the surroundings\\nor the passage of time are not noticed. Another example\\nmight be driving on the highway and taking several exits\\nwithout noticing or remembering. Dissociation is related\\nto hypnosis in that hypnotic trance also involves a tem-\\nporarily altered state of consciousness. Most patients\\nwith dissociative disorders are highly hypnotizable.\\nPeople in other cultures sometimes have dissociative\\nexperiences in the course of religious (in certain trance\\nstates) or other group activities. These occurrences\\nshould not be judged in terms of what is considered “nor-\\nmal” in the United States.\\nModerate or severe forms of dissociation are caused\\nby such traumatic experiences as childhood abuse, com-\\nbat, criminal attacks, brainwashing in hostage situations,\\nor involvement in a natural or transportation disaster.\\nPatients with acute stress disorder , post-traumatic\\nstress disorder (PTSD), or conversion disorder and\\nsomatization disorder may develop dissociative symp-\\ntoms. Recent studies of trauma indicate that the human\\nbrain stores traumatic memories in a different way than\\nnormal memories. Traumatic memories are not\\nprocessed or integrated into a person’s ongoing life in\\nthe same fashion as normal memories. Instead they are\\ndissociated, or “split off,” and may erupt into conscious-\\nness from time to time without warning. The affected\\nperson cannot control or “edit” these memories. Over a\\nperiod of time, these two sets of memories, the normal\\nand the traumatic, may coexist as parallel sets without\\nbeing combined or blended. In extreme cases, different\\nsets of dissociated memories may alter subpersonalities\\nof patients with dissociative identity disorder (multiple\\npersonality disorder).\\nThe dissociative disorders vary in their severity and\\nthe suddenness of onset.

Patients with dissociative\\namnesia may develop depersonalization or trance\\nstates as part of the disorder, but they do not experi-\\nence a change in identity.\\nDissociative fugue\\nDissociative fugue is a disorder in which a person\\ntemporarily loses his or her sense of personal identity and\\ntravels to another location where he or she may assume a\\nnew identity. Again, this condition usually follows a\\nmajor stressor or trauma. Apart from inability to recall\\ntheir past or personal information, patients with dissocia-\\ntive fugue do not behave strangely or appear disturbed to\\nothers. Cases of dissociative fugue are more common in\\nwartime or in communities disrupted by a natural disaster.\\nDepersonalization disorder\\nDepersonalization disorder is a disturbance in\\nwhich the patient’s primary symptom is a sense of\\ndetachment from the self. Depersonalization as a symp-\\ntom (not as a disorder) is quite common in college-age\\npopulations. It is often associated with sleep deprivation\\nor “recreational” drug use. It may be accompanied by\\n“derealization” (where objects in an environment appear\\naltered). Patients sometimes describe depersonalization\\nas feeling like a robot or watching themselves from the\\noutside. Depersonalization disorder may also involve\\nfeelings of numbness or loss of emotional “aliveness.”\\nDissociative identity disorder (DID)\\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) is the newer\\nname for multiple personality disorder (MPD).

The\\nbrain’s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of memories\\nare still not fully understood.

Doctors can distinguish this type of\\namnesia from loss of memory caused by head injuries or\\ndrug intoxication, because the amnesia is “spotty” and\\nrelated to highly charged events and feelings.\\nDepersonalization\\nDepersonalization is a dissociative symptom in\\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unreal, is\\nchanging, or is dissolving.

These physical conditions include\\nepilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med-\\nications, substance abuse, intoxication,AIDS, dementia\\ncomplex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress\\nand sleeplessness.

In addition, doctors can use some psy-\\nchological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen-\\ner, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES).

Some diuretics are also prescribed to treat\\nhigh blood pressure. These drugs act on the kidneys to\\nincrease urine output. This reduces the amount of fluid in\\nthe bloodstream, which in turn lowers blood pressure.\\nDescription\\nThere are several types of diuretics, also called water\\npills:\\n• Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (Bumex) and\\nfurosemide (Lasix), get their name from the loop-\\nshaped part of the kidneys where they have their effect.\\n• Thiazide diuretics include such commonly used diuret-\\nics as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Esidrix),\\nchlorothiazide (Diuril), and chlorthalidone (Hygroton).\\n• Potassium-sparing diuretics prevent the loss of potassi-\\num, which is a problem with other types of diuretics.\\nExamples of potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride\\n(Midamor) and triamterene (Dyrenium).\\nIn addition, some medicines contain combinations\\nof two diuretics. The brands Dyazide and Maxzide, for\\nexample, contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochloroth-\\niazide with the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene.\\nSome nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines\\ncontain diuretics. However, the medicines described\\nhere cannot be bought without a physician’s prescrip-\\ntion. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, and\\ninjectable forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\ndiuretic and may be different for different patients.\\nCheck with the physician who prescribed the drug or the\\npharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct\\ndosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed.\\nPrecautions\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking a diuretic\\nis important. The physician will check to make sure the\\nmedicine is working as it should and will watch for\\nunwanted side effects.\\nSome people feel unusually tired when they first\\nstart taking diuretics.

These\\noutpouchings are called diverticula. Diverticulitis refers\\nto the development of inflammation and infection in one\\nor more diverticula.\\nDescription\\nDiverticula tend to occur most frequently in the\\nlast segment of the large intestine, the sigmoid colon.\\nThey occur with decreasing frequency as one examines\\nfurther back toward the beginning of the large intes-\\ntine. The chance of developing diverticula increases\\nwith age, so that by the age of 50, about 20–50% of all\\npeople will have some diverticula. By the age of 90,\\nvirtually everyone will have developed some diverticu-\\nla. Most diverticula measure about 3 mm to just over 3\\ncm in diameter. Larger diverticula, termed giant diver-\\nticula, are quite infrequent, but may measure as large\\nas 15 cm in diameter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDiverticula are believed to be caused by overly\\nforceful contractions of the muscular wall of the large\\nintestine. As areas of this wall spasm, they become weak-\\ner and weaker, allowing the inner lining to bulge through.\\nThe anatomically weakest areas of the intestinal wall\\noccur next to blood vessels which course through the\\nwall, so diverticula commonly occur in this location.\\nDiverticula are most common in the developed\\ncountries of the West (North America, Great Britain,\\nnorthern and western Europe). This is thought to be due\\nto the diet of these countries, which tends to be quite low\\nin fiber. A diet low in fiber results in the production of\\nsmaller volumes of stool. In order to move this smaller\\nstool along the colon and out of the rectum, the colon\\nmust narrow itself significantly, and does so by contract-\\ning down forcefully. This causes an increase in pressure,\\nwhich, over time, weakens the muscular wall of the intes-\\ntine and allows diverticular pockets to develop.\\nThe origin of giant diverticula development is not\\ncompletely understood, although one theory involves gas\\nrepeatedly entering and becoming trapped in an already-\\nexisting diverticulum, causing stretching and expansion\\nof that diverticulum.\\nThe great majority of people with diverticulosis will\\nremain symptom-free. Many diverticula are quite acci-\\ndentally discovered during examinations for other condi-\\ntions of the intestinal tract.\\nSome people with diverticulosis have symptoms such\\nas constipation , cramping, and bloating. It is unclear\\nwhether these symptoms are actually caused by the diver-\\nticula themselves, or whether some other gastrointestinal\\ncondition (such as irritable bowel syndrome ) might be\\nresponsible. A complication of diverticulosis occurs\\nbecause many diverticula develop in areas very near\\nblood vessels. Therefore, one serious risk of diverticulosis\\ninvolves bleeding. Although an infrequent complication,\\nthe bleeding can be quite severe. Seventy-five percent of\\nsuch bleeding episodes occur due to diverticula located on\\nthe right side of the colon. About 50% of the time, such\\nbleeding will stop on its own.\\nOne of the most common and potentially serious\\ncomplications of diverticulosis is inflammation and infec-\\ntion of a particular diverticulum, called diverticulitis.\\nDiverticulitis is three times more likely to occur in\\nthe left side of the large intestine. Since most diverticula\\nare located in the sigmoid colon (the final segment of the\\nlarge intestine which empties into the rectum), most\\ndiverticulitis also takes place in the sigmoid. The elderly\\nhave the most serious complications from diverticulitis,\\nalthough very severe infections can also occur in patients\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1091\\nDiverticulosis and diverticulitis\\nA barium study x ray showing colonic diverticulosis.(Cus-\\ntom Medical Stock Photo.

Men are three times as likely as\\nwomen to be stricken with diverticulitis.\\nDiverticulitis is believed to occur when a hardened\\npiece of stool, undigested food, and bacteria (called a\\nfecalith) becomes lodged in a diverticulum. This block-\\nage interferes with the blood supply to the area, and\\ninfection sets in.\\nAn individual with diverticulitis will experience pain\\n(especially in the lower left side of the abdomen) and fever.\\nIn response to the infection and the irritation of nearby tis-\\nsues within the abdomen, the abdominal muscles may\\nbegin to spasm. About 25% of all patients with diverticuli-\\ntis will have some rectal bleeding, although this rarely\\nbecomes severe. Walled-off pockets of infection, called\\nabscesses, may appear within the wall of the intestine, or\\neven on the exterior surface of the intestine. When a diver-\\nticulum weakens sufficiently, and is filled to bulging with\\ninfected pus, a perforation in the intestinal wall may devel-\\nop. When the infected contents of the intestine spill out into\\nthe abdomen, the severe infection called peritonitis may\\noccur. Peritonitis is an infection and inflammation of the\\nlining of the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum. Other com-\\nplications of diverticulitis include the formation of abnor-\\nmal connections between two organs that normally do not\\nconnect (fistulas; for example, the intestine and the blad-\\nder), and scarring outside of the intestine which squeezes\\noff a portion of the intestine, obstructing it.\\nDiagnosis\\nAs mentioned, the majority of diverticula do not\\ncause any symptoms, and are often found by coincidence\\nduring an examination being performed for some other\\nmedical condition.\\nWhen diverticula are suspected because a patient\\nbegins to have sudden rectal bleeding, the location of the\\nbleeding can be studied by performing an angiography.\\nAngiography involves inserting a tiny tube through an\\nartery in the leg, and moving it up into one of the major\\narteries of the gastrointestinal system. A particular chem-\\nical (contrast medium) which will show up on x-ray\\nfilms is injected, and the area of bleeding is located by\\nlooking for an area where the contrast is leaking into the\\ninterior (lumen) of the intestine.\\nA procedure called endoscopy provides another\\nmethod for examining the colon and locating the site of\\nbleeding. In endoscopy, a small, flexible scope (endo-\\nscope) is inserted through the rectum and into the intes-\\ntine. The scope usually bears a fiber-optic camera, which\\nallows the view through this endoscope to be projected\\nonto a television screen. The operator can introduce the\\nendoscope further and further through the intestine to\\nfind the location of the bleeding.\\nDiagnosis of diverticulitis is not difficult in\\npatients with previously diagnosed diverticulosis. The\\npresence of abdominal pain and fever in such an indi-\\nvidual would make the suspicion of diverticulitis quite\\nhigh. Examination of the abdomen will usually reveal\\ntenderness to touch, with the patient’s abdominal mus-\\ncles contracting strongly to protect the tender area.\\nDuring a rectal exam (performed by inserting a finger\\ninto the rectum), a doctor may be able to feel an\\nabnormal mass. Touching this mass may prove painful\\nto the patient.\\nWhen a practitioner is suspicious of diverticulitis as\\nthe cause for the patient’s symptoms, he or she will most\\nlikely avoid the types of tests usually used to diagnose\\ngastrointestinal disorders. These include barium enema\\nand endoscopy. The concern is that the increased pres-\\nsure exerted on the intestine during these exams may\\nincrease the likelihood of intestinal perforation. After\\nmedical treatment for the diverticulitis, these examina-\\ntions may be performed in order to learn the extent of the\\npatient’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nOnly about 20% of patients with diverticulosis ever\\nhave symptoms which lead them to seek medical help.\\nMost people never know that they have diverticula. For\\nthose individuals who have cramping pain and constipa-\\ntion believed to be due to diverticulosis, the usual pre-\\nscription involves increasing the fiber in the diet. This\\ncan be done by adding special diet supplements of bran\\nor psyllium seed, which increase stool volume. Bleeding\\ndiverticula can usually be treated by bed rest, with blood\\ntransfusionneeded for more severe bleeding (hemor-\\nrhaging). In cases of very heavy hemorrhaging, medica-\\ntions which encourage clotting can be injected during the\\ncourse of a diagnostic angiography.\\nWhile there are almost no situations when uncom-\\nplicated diverticulosis requires surgery, giant diverticula\\nalways require removal. This is due to the very high\\nchance of infection and perforation of these diverticula.\\nWhen giant diverticula are diagnosed, the usual treat-\\nment involves removing that portion of the intestine.\\nTreatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis usually\\nrequires hospitalization. “Resting the bowel” is a main-\\nstay of treatment, and involves keeping the patient from\\neating or sometimes even drinking anything by mouth.\\nTherefore, the patient will need to receive fluids through\\na needle in the vein (intravenous or IV fluids). Antibi-\\notics will also be administered through the IV . Some\\nphysicians will agree to try treatment at home for very\\nmildly ill patients. These patients will be put on a liquid\\ndiet and receive oral antibiotics.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1092\\nDiverticulosis and diverticulitis'),\n",

In general, syncope is\\ndefined by a brief loss of consciousness (fainting) or by\\ndimmed vision and feeling uncoordinated, confused, and\\nlightheaded. Many people experience a sensation like\\nsyncope when they stand up too fast. Vertigo is the feeling\\nthat either the individual or the surroundings are spinning.\\nThis sensation is like being on a spinning amusement\\npark ride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizzi-\\nness feel as though they cannot keep their balance. This\\nfeeling may become worse with movement.\\nDescription\\nThe brain coordinates information from the eyes, the\\ninner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. If\\nany of these information sources is disrupted, the brain\\nmay not be able to compensate. For example, people\\nsometimes experience motion sickness because the\\ninformation from their body tells the brain that they are\\nsitting still, but information from the eyes indicates that\\nthey are moving. The messages don’t correspond and\\ndizziness results.\\nVision and the body’s senses are the most important\\nsystems for maintaining balance, but problems in the\\ninner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. The\\ninner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluid\\nthat helps fine tune the information the brain receives\\nfrom the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pres-\\nsure in one inner ear changes, information about balance\\nis altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages to\\nthe brain about balance and induces dizziness.\\nCertain medical conditions can cause dizziness,\\nbecause they affect the systems that maintain balance.\\nFor example, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes in\\nblood flow. Because medical conditions such as high\\nblood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow,\\nthese conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-\\nness. Circulation disorders are the most common causes\\nof dizziness. Other causes are head injury, ear infection,\\nallergies, and nervous system disorders.\\nDizziness often disappears without treatment or with\\ntreatment of the underlying problem, but it can be long\\nterm or chronic. According to the National Institutes of\\nHealth, 42% of Americans will seek medical help for\\ndizziness at some point in their lives. The costs may\\nexceed a billion dollars and account for five million doc-\\ntor visits annually. Episodes of dizziness increase with\\nage. Among people aged 75 or older, dizziness is the\\nmost frequent reason for seeing a doctor.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCareful attention to symptoms can help determine\\nthe underlying cause of the dizziness. Underlying prob-\\nlems may be benign and easily treated or they may be\\ndangerous and in need of intensive therapy. Not all cases\\nof dizziness can be linked to a specific cause. More than\\none type of dizziness can be experienced at the same\\ntime and symptoms may be mixed. Episodes of dizziness\\nmay last for a few seconds or for days. The length of an\\nepisode is related to the underlying cause.\\nThe symptoms of syncope include dimmed vision,\\nloss of coordination, confusion, lightheadedness, and\\nsweating.

They are related to a reduced flow\\nof blood to the brain; they often occur when a person is\\nstanding up and can be relieved by sitting or lying down.\\nVertigo is characterized by a sensation of spinning or turn-\\ning, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears,\\nheadache, or fatigue. An individual may have trouble\\nwalking, remaining coordinated, or keeping balance. Non-\\nsyncope nonvertigo dizziness is characterized by a feeling\\nof being off balance that becomes worse if the individual\\ntries moving or performing detail-intense tasks.\\nA person may experience dizziness for many rea-\\nsons. Syncope is associated with low blood pressure,\\nheart problems, and disorders in the autonomic nervous\\nsystem, the system of involuntary functions such as\\nbreathing. Syncope may also arise from emotional dis-\\ntress,pain, and other reactions to outside stressors. Non-\\nsyncope nonvertigo dizziness may be caused by rapid\\nbreathing, low blood sugar, or migraine headache ,a s\\nwell as by more serious medical conditions.\\nVertigo is often associated with inner ear problems\\ncalled vestibular disorders. A particularly intense vestibular\\ndisorder, Méniére’s disease, interferes with the volume of\\nfluid in the inner ear. This disease, which affects approxi-\\nmately one in every 1,000 people, causes intermittent verti-\\ngo over the course of weeks, months, or years. Méniére’s\\ndisease is often accompanied by ringing or buzzing in the\\near,hearing loss , and a feeling that the ear is blocked.\\nDamage to the nerve that leads from the ear to the brain can\\nalso cause vertigo. Such damage can result from head\\ninjury or a tumor. An acoustic neuroma, for example, is a\\nbenign tumor that wraps around the nerve. Vertigo can also\\nbe caused by disorders of the central nervous system and\\nthe circulatory system, such as hardening of the arteries\\n(arteriosclerosis),stroke, or multiple sclerosis.\\nSome medications cause changes in blood pressure\\nor blood flow. These medications can cause dizziness in\\nsome people. Prescription medications carry warnings\\nof such side effects, but common drugs, such as caf-\\nfeine or nicotine can also cause dizziness. Certain\\nantibiotics can damage the inner ear and cause hearing\\nloss and dizziness.\\nDiet may cause dizziness. The role of diet may be\\ndirect, as through alcohol intake. It may be also be indi-\\nrect, as through arteriosclerosis caused by a high-fat diet.\\nSome people experience a slight dip in blood sugar and\\nmild dizziness if they miss a meal, but this condition is\\nrarely dangerous unless the person is diabetic. Food sen-\\nsitivities or allergies can also be a cause of dizziness.\\nChronic conditions, such as heart disease, and serious\\nacute problems, such as seizures and strokes, can cause\\ndizziness. However, such conditions usually exhibit other\\ncharacteristic symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDuring the initial medical examination, an individ-\\nual with dizziness should provide a detailed description\\nof the type of dizziness experienced, when it occurs, and\\nhow often each episode lasts. A diary of symptoms may\\nhelp track this information. Report any symptoms that\\naccompany the dizziness, such as a ringing in the ear or\\nnausea, any recent injury or infection, and any medica-\\ntion taken.\\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiration, and body temper-\\nature are checked, and the ear, nose, and throat are scruti-\\nnized. The sense of balance is assessed by moving the\\nindividual’s head to various positions or by tilt-table test-\\ning. In tilt-table testing, the person lies on a table that can\\nbe shifted into different positions and reports any dizzi-\\nness that occurs.\\nFurther tests may be indicated by the initial exami-\\nnation. Hearing tests help assess ear damage. x rays,\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), and magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) can pinpoint evidence of\\nnerve damage, tumor, or other structural problems. If a\\nvestibular disorder is suspected, a technique called\\nelectronystagmography (ENG) may be used. ENG mea-\\nsures the electrical impulses generated by eye move-\\nments. Blood tests can determine diabetes,high choles-\\nterol, and other diseases. In some cases, a heart evalua-\\ntion may be useful. Despite thorough testing, an underly-\\ning cause cannot always be determined.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is determined by the underlying cause. If\\nan individual has a cold or influenza, a few days of bed\\nrest is usually adequate to resolve dizziness. Other caus-\\nes of dizziness, such as mild vestibular system damage,\\nmay resolve without medical treatment.\\nIf dizziness continues, drug therapy may prove\\nhelpful. Because circulatory problems often cause dizzi-\\nness, medication may be prescribed to control blood\\npressure or to treat arteriosclerosis. Sedatives may be\\nuseful to relieve the tension that can trigger or aggravate\\ndizziness. Low blood sugar associated with diabetes\\nsometimes causes dizziness and is treated by controlling\\nblood sugar levels. An individual may be asked to avoid\\ncaffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and any substances that\\ncause allergic reactions. A low-salt diet may also help\\nsome people.\\nWhen other measures have failed, surgery may be\\nsuggested to relieve pressure on the inner ear. If the\\ndizziness is not treatable by drugs, surgery, or other\\nmeans, physical therapy may be used and the patient may\\nbe taught coping mechanisms for the problem.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1095\\nDizziness'),\n",

It is frequently\\nused to detect problems with heart valves or to measure\\nblood flow through the arteries.

It is harmless,\\npainless, and widely available.\\nDescription\\nDoppler ultrasonography makes use of two different\\nprinciples. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high-\\nfrequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it will\\nbe reflected by its target and the reflected sound can be\\ndetected back at its origin. In addition, it is known that\\ncertain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce an\\nelectrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound.\\nThe Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch\\nincreases as the source moves toward the listener and\\ndecreases as it moves away.\\nMedical science utilizes these two principles in the\\nfollowing way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe)\\ncontaining piezoelectric crystals sends a series of short\\nsound pulses into the body and pauses between each\\npulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machine\\nthen determines the direction and depth of each returning\\nsound and coverts this into a point of light on a television\\nmonitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed and\\ndisplayed every second to produce an image of the organ\\nbeing studied. The image allows the doctor to see the\\norgan functioning in real time.\\nThe newest addition to this test is the addition of\\ncolor. Adding color to the image shows the direction and\\nrate of blood flow more clearly.\\nDuring a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the\\ntechnician will apply a gel to the skin, then place the\\ntransducer against the skin at various angles. The trans-\\nducer sends the information it receives to a television\\nmonitor that shows a moving image of the organ being\\nstudied.

It\\noccurs because of the presence of an extra chromosome.\\nDescription\\nChromosomes are the units of genetic information\\nthat exist within every cell of the body. Twenty-three dis-\\ntinctive pairs, or 46 total chromosomes, are located with-\\nin the nucleus (central structure) of each cell. When a\\nbaby is conceived by the combining of one sperm cell\\nwith one egg cell, the baby receives 23 chromosomes\\nfrom each parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Some-\\ntimes, an accident in the production of a sperm or egg\\ncell causes that cell to contain 24 chromosomes. This\\nKEY TERMS\\nDoppler effect —The principle that the sound of\\nan object moving toward you has a higher pitch\\nthan the sound when it’s moving away from you.\\nTransducer—The part of a machine that changes\\nsignals in one form into another form.\\nUltrasound—Sound that is too high for the human\\near to hear.\\nevent is referred to as nondisjunction. When this defec-\\ntive cell is involved in the conception of a baby, that baby\\nwill have a total of 47 chromosomes. The extra chromo-\\nsome in Down syndrome is labeled number 21. For this\\nreason, the existence of three such chromosomes is\\nsometimes referred to as Trisomy 21.\\nIn a very rare number of Down syndrome cases\\n(about 1–2%), the original egg and sperm cells are com-\\npletely normal. The problem occurs sometime shortly\\nafter fertilization; during the phase where cells are divid-\\ning rapidly. One cell divides abnormally, creating a line\\nof cells with an extra chromosome 21. This form of\\ngenetic disorder is called a mosaic. The individual with\\nthis type of Down syndrome has two types of cells: those\\nwith 46 chromosomes (the normal number), and those\\nwith 47 chromosomes (as occurs in Down syndrome).\\nSome researchers have suggested that individuals with\\nthis type of mosaic form of Down syndrome have less\\nsevere signs and symptoms of the disorder.\\nAnother relatively rare genetic accident which can\\ncause Down syndrome is called translocation. During cell\\ndivision, the number 21 chromosome somehow breaks. A\\npiece of the 21 chromosome then becomes attached to\\nanother chromosome. Each cell still has 46 chromosomes,\\nbut the extra piece of chromosome 21 results in the signs\\nand symptoms of Down syndrome. Translocations occur\\nin about 3–4% of cases of Down syndrome.\\nDown syndrome occurs in about one in every\\n800–1,000 births. It affects an equal number of boys and\\ngirls. Less than 25% of Down syndrome cases occur due\\nto an extra chromosome in the sperm cell. The majority\\nof cases of Down syndrome occur due to an extra chro-\\nmosome 21 within the egg cell supplied by the mother\\n(nondisjunction). As a woman’s age (maternal age)\\nincreases, the risk of having a Down syndrome baby\\nincreases significantly. For example, at younger ages, the\\nrisk is about one in 4,000. By the time the woman is age\\n35, the risk increases to one in 400; by age 40 the risk\\nincreases to one in 110; and by age 45 the risk becomes\\none in 35. There is no increased risk of either mosaicism\\nor translocation with increased maternal age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder, a\\nbaby is usually identified at birth through observation of\\na set of common physical characteristics. Babies with\\nDown syndrome tend to be overly quiet, less responsive,\\nwith weak, floppy muscles. Furthermore, a number of\\nphysical signs may be present. These include:\\n• flat appearing face\\n• small head\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1098\\nDown syndrome'),\n",

About 30–50% of all children with Down syn-\\ndrome are found to have heart defects. A number of dif-\\nferent heart defects are common in Down syndrome,\\nincluding abnormal openings (holes) in the walls that\\nseparate the heart’s chambers (atrial septal defect, ven-\\ntricular septal defect). These result in abnormal patterns\\nof blood flow within the heart. The abnormal blood flow\\noften means that less oxygen is sent into circulation\\nthroughout the body. Another heart defect that occurs in\\nDown syndrome is called Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy\\nof Fallot consists of a hole in the heart, along with three\\nother major heart defects.\\nMalformations of the gastrointestinal tract are pre-\\nsent in about 5–7% of children with Down syndrome.\\nThe most common malformation is a narrowed, obstruct-\\ned duodenum (the part of the intestine into which the\\nstomach empties). This disorder, called duodenal atresia,\\ninterferes with the baby’s milk or formula leaving the\\nstomach and entering the intestine for digestion. The\\nbaby often vomits forcibly after feeding, and cannot gain\\nweight appropriately until the defect is repaired.\\nOther medical conditions that occur in patients with\\nDown syndrome include an increased chance of develop-\\ning infections, especially ear infections and pneumonia;\\ncertain kidney disorders; thyroid disease (especially low\\nor hypothyroid); hearing loss; vision impairment requir-\\ning glasses (corrective lenses); and a 20-times greater\\nchance of developing leukemia (a blood disorder).\\nDevelopment in a baby and child with Down syn-\\ndrome occurs at a much slower than normal rate.\\nBecause of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies\\nlearn to sit up, crawl, and walk much later than their nor-\\nmal peers. Talking is also quite delayed. The level of\\nmental retardation is considered to be mild-to-moderate\\nin Down syndrome. The actual IQ range of Down syn-\\ndrome children is quite varied, but the majority of such\\nchildren are in what is sometimes known as the trainable\\nrange. This means that most people with Down syn-\\ndrome can be trained to do regular self-care tasks, func-\\ntion in a socially appropriate manner in a normal home\\nenvironment, and even hold simple jobs.\\nAs people with Down syndrome age, they face an\\nincreased chance of developing the brain disease called\\nAlzheimer’s (sometimes referred to as dementia or\\nsenility). Most people have a six in 100 risk of develop-\\ning Alzheimer’s, but people with Down syndrome have a\\n25 in 100 chance of the disease. Alzheimer’s disease\\ncauses the brain to shrink and to break down. The num-\\nber of brain cells decreases, and abnormal deposits and\\nstructural arrangements occur. This process results in a\\nloss of brain functioning. People with Alzheimer’s have\\nstrikingly faulty memories. Over time, people with\\nAlzheimer’s disease will lapse into an increasingly unre-\\nsponsive state. Some researchers have shown that even\\nDown syndrome patients who do not appear to have\\nAlzheimer’s disease have the same changes occurring to\\nthe structures and cells of their brains.\\nAs people with Down syndrome age, they also have\\nan increased chance of developing a number of other ill-\\nnesses, including cataracts, thyroid problems, diabetes,\\nand seizure disorders.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually suspected at birth, when the\\ncharacteristic physical signs of Down syndrome are\\nnoted. Once this suspicion has been raised,genetic test-\\ning (chromosome analysis) can be undertaken in order to\\nverify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usually\\ndone on a blood sample, although chromosome analysis\\ncan also be done on other types of tissue, including skin.\\nThe cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory.\\nChemical stain is added to make the characteristics of the\\ncells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals are\\nadded to prompt the cells to go through normal develop-\\nment, up to the point where the chromosomes are most\\nvisible, prior to cell division. At this point, they are\\nexamined under a microscope and photographed. The\\nphotograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapes\\nof chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn-\\ndrome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. The\\nfinal result of such testing, with the photographed chro-\\nmosomes paired and organized by shape and size, is\\ncalled the individual’s karyotype.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1099\\nDown syndrome'),\n",

For example, heart defects\\nwill many times require surgical repair, as will duodenal\\natresia. Many Down syndrome patients will need to wear\\nglasses to correct vision. Patients with hearing impair-\\nment benefit from hearing aids.\\nA new drug, referred to as a “smart drug,” has been\\nreceiving some attention in the treatment of Down syn-\\ndrome patients. This drug, piracetam, has not been\\nproven to increase intellectual ability, despite testimoni-\\nals that have been receiving attention on television and\\nthe Internet. Piracetam has not been approved for use in\\nthe United States, although it is being sold via the Inter-\\nnet. The National Down Syndrome Society and the\\nNational Down Syndrome Congress do not recommend\\nthe use of this drug as of 2001.\\nWhile some decades ago, all Down syndrome chil-\\ndren were quickly placed into institutions for lifelong\\ncare. Research shows very clearly that the best outlook\\nfor children with Down syndrome is a normal family life\\nin their own home. This requires careful support and edu-\\ncation of the parents and the siblings. It is a life-changing\\nevent to learn that a new baby has a permanent condition\\nthat will effect essentially all aspects of his or her devel-\\nopment. Some community groups exist to help families\\ndeal with the emotional effects of this new information,\\nand to help plan for the baby’s future. Schools are\\nrequired to provide services for children with Down syn-\\ndrome, sometimes in separate special education class-\\nrooms, and sometimes in regular classrooms (this is\\ncalled mainstreaming or inclusion).\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis in Down syndrome is quite variable,\\ndepending on the types of complications (heart defects,\\nsusceptibility to infections, development of leukemia) of\\neach individual baby. The severity of the retardation can\\nalso vary significantly. Without the presence of heart\\ndefects, about 90% of children with Down syndrome live\\ninto their teens. People with Down syndrome appear to\\ngo through the normal physical changes of aging more\\nrapidly, however. The average age of death for an indi-\\nvidual with Down syndrome is about 50–55 years.\\nStill, the prognosis for a baby born with Down syn-\\ndrome is better than ever before. Because of modern\\nmedical treatments, including antibiotics to treat infec-\\ntions and surgery to treat heart defects and duodenal atre-\\nsia, life expectancy has greatly increased. Community\\nand family support allows people with Down syndrome\\nto have rich, meaningful relationships. Because of educa-\\ntional programs, some people with Down syndrome are\\nable to hold jobs.\\nMen with Down syndrome appear to be uniformly\\nsterile (meaning that they are unable to have offspring).\\nWomen with Down syndrome, however, are fully capa-\\nble of having babies. About 50% of these babies, howev-\\ner, will also be born with Down syndrome.\\nPrevention\\nEfforts at prevention of Down syndrome are aimed\\nat genetic counseling of couples who are preparing to\\nhave babies. A counselor needs to inform a woman that\\nher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increases\\nwith her increasing age. Two types of testing is available\\nduring a pregnancy to determine if the baby being car-\\nried has Down syndrome.\\nScreening tests are used to estimate the chance that\\nan individual woman will have a baby with Down syn-\\ndrome. At 14–17 weeks of pregnancy, measurements of a\\nsubstance called AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) can be per-\\nformed. AFP is normally found circulating in the blood\\nof a pregnant woman, but may be unusually high or low\\nwith certain disorders. Carrying a baby with Down syn-\\ndrome often causes AFP to be lower than normal. This\\ninformation alone, or along with measurements of two\\nother hormones, is considered along with the mother’s\\nage to calculate the risk of the baby being born with\\nDown syndrome. These results are only predictions, and\\nare only correct about 60% of the time.\\nThe only way to definitively establish (with about\\n98–99% accuracy) the presence or absence of Down syn-\\ndrome in a developing baby, is to test tissue from the\\npregnancy itself. This is usually done either by amnio-\\ncentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In amnio-\\ncentesis, a small amount of the fluid in which the baby is\\nfloating is withdrawn with a long, thin needle. In chori-\\nonic villus sampling, a tiny tube is inserted into the open-\\ning of the uterus to retrieve a small sample of the placen-\\nta (the organ that attaches the growing baby to the moth-\\ner via the umbilical cord, and provides oxygen and\\nnutrition). Both amniocentesis and CVS allow the\\nbaby’s own karyotype to be determined. A couple must\\nthen decide whether to use this information in order to\\nbegin to prepare for the arrival of a baby with Down syn-\\ndrome, or to terminate the pregnancy.\\nOnce a couple has had one baby with Down syn-\\ndrome, they are often concerned about the likelihood of\\nfuture offspring also being born with the disorder.

Interactions can lessen or magnify the desired\\ntherapeutic effect of a drug, or may cause unwanted or\\nunexpected side effects. There are thousands of possible\\ndrug-to-drug and drug-to-food interactions, and many\\nmedications and supplements are contraindicated (not\\nrecommended) under certain conditions or in patients\\nwith specific diseases and disorders. This is why it is\\nimperative that patients always keep their physician fully\\ninformed about all drugs and dietary supplements\\n(including herbal remedies) they are taking.\\nDescription\\nThe primary site of drug metabolism is the liver, the\\norgan that plays a major role in metabolism, digestion,\\ndetoxification,and elimination of substances from the\\nbody. Enzymes in the liver are responsible for chemically\\nchanging drug components into substances known as\\nmetabolites. Metabolites are then bound to other sub-\\nstances for excretion through the lungs, or bodily fluids\\nsuch as saliva, sweat, breast milk, and urine, or through\\nreabsorption by the intestines. The primary mode of\\nexcretion is through the kidneys.\\nThe family of liver isoenzymes known as cytochrome\\nP-450 are crucial to drug metabolism. These enzymes\\n(labeled CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and\\nCYP3A4) have a catabolic action on substances, breaking\\nthem down into metabolites. Consequently, they also act to\\nlower the concentration of medication in the bloodstream.\\nDrug interactions can occur when one drug inhibits\\nor induces a P-450 that acts on another drug. An exam-\\nple is nicotine, a drug contained in tobacco, and known\\nto induce P-450s. Individuals with liver disease (e.g.,\\ncirrhosis) may also have insufficient levels of P-450\\nenzymes. As a result, the concentration of drugs metab-\\nolized by these enzymes (e.g., amprenavir and other\\nprotease inhibitors) remains high and can build up to\\ntoxic levels in the bloodstream. In addition, certain\\nmedications and foods, such as grapefruit juice, can\\ninactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of P-450s.\\nChanging the drug dosage can alleviate the problem in\\nsome cases.\\nThe metabolic rate can vary significantly from per-\\nson to person, and drug dosages that work quickly and\\neffectively in one individual may not work well for\\nanother. Factors such as genetics, environment,nutri-\\ntion and age also influence drug metabolism; infants\\nand elderly patients may have a reduced capacity to\\nmetabolize certain drugs, and may require adjustments\\nin dosage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDrugs that commonly interact with other medica-\\ntions include:\\n•Diuretics . Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide can\\nreduce serum potassium and sodium electrolyte levels\\nwhen taken with digoxin and lithium, respectively.\\n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOI antide-\\npressants can cause convulsions and other serious side\\neffects when used with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g.,\\nImipramine, Nortriptyline),selective serotonin reup-\\ntake inhibitors (SSRIs), or sympathomimetic drugs\\n(e.g., amphetamines).\\n• Antibiotics . Antibiotics may reduce the efficiency of\\noral contraceptives.\\n• Metals. Medications containing metals, such as\\nantacids with aluminum additives and iron supple-\\nments, can reduce the absorption of tetracyclines and\\nfluoroquinolones.\\n• Drugs that inhibit liver enzyme function. Drugs that\\nslow drug metabolism include ciprofloxacin, ery-\\nthromycin, fluoxetine, nefazodone, paroxetine, and\\nritonavir. The therapeutic effect of other medications\\ntaken with these drugs may be amplified. Warfarin, a\\nblood thinner, should be used with great caution in indi-\\nviduals taking these drugs.\\nFoods and beverages that may interact with drugs\\ninclude:\\n• Grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabo-\\nlism of many medications, including cyclosporine,\\nfelodipine, nifedipine, nitrendipine, nisoldipine, carba-\\nmazepine, triazolam, and midazolam.\\n• Foods and beverages with tyramines. Red wine, malted\\nbeers, smoked foods (e.g., fish and meats), dried fruits,\\nand aged cheeses may contain tyramines, and can cause\\na severe and dangerous elevation in blood pressure\\nwhen taken with MAOI inhibitors (a class of antide-\\npressants).\\n• Dairy products. Milk, cream, and other dairy products\\ncontaining calcium can prevention the absorption of\\nantibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and\\nciprofloxacin when they are taken with the drug. In\\naddition, whole milk with vitamin D can cause milk-\\nalkali syndrome in patients taking aluminum hydroxide\\nantacids.\\n• Caffeinated beverages. The caffeine contained in cof-\\nfee and colas can influence drug metabolism.\\n• Alcohol. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant,\\nand should not be taken with other CNS depressants\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1102\\nDrug metabolism/interactions'),\n",

Taken in combination with other drugs or with\\nalcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can cause\\ndeathor serious long term consequences. Children are\\nparticularly at risk for accidental overdose, accounting\\nfor over one million poisonings each year from drugs,\\nalcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo-\\nple who suffer from depression and who have suicidal\\nthoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAccidental drug overdose may be the result of mis-\\nuse of prescription medicines or commonly used medica-\\ntions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms\\ndiffer depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugs\\ncommonly involved in overdoses are listed below along\\nwith symptoms and outcomes.\\nAcetaminophen is the generic name for the com-\\nmonly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drug\\ncauses liver damage with symptoms that include loss of\\nappetite, tiredness,nausea and vomiting , paleness, and\\nsweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liver\\nfailure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness,\\nswelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liver\\nenzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning, liver failure\\nadvances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel-\\nlowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may also\\nexperience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, and\\nencephalopathy (swelling of the brain).\\nAnticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of\\nacetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo-\\nlamine, belladonna,antihistamines , and antipsychotic\\nagents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouth\\nand nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, an\\ninability to urinate, and mental disturbances are also\\nsymptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormal\\nheart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma.\\nAntidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi-\\npramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate,\\nvomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. An\\noverdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similar\\nto those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses.\\nCholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the\\nparasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate and\\npilocarpine cause nausea,diarrhea, increased secretion\\nof body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue ,\\nand muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Death\\ncan occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure.\\nCocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures,\\nhigh blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia, and\\nother changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are\\nserious risks within three days after cocaine overdose.\\nDepressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs,\\nsleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech,\\ndifficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impaired\\nability to think, disorientation, and mood changes.

Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are\\nalso in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes\\nsedation(sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart\\nrate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the\\nblack centers of the eyes become smaller than normal,\\nare common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs\\nare taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun-\\nteract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the\\npatient will stop breathing.\\nSalicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or\\nointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay),\\nand creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp-\\ntoms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting,\\npossibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will\\ncause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con-\\nditions where the body’s acid/base balance is malfunc-\\ntioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast\\nbreathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion,\\nhallucinations, tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An\\nincreased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious\\ncomplications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart\\nfailure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the\\nsymptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten-\\nsive damage to the body before significant symptoms\\ndevelop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able\\nto tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The\\npatient’s recent medical and social history may also help\\nin a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the\\npatient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed\\nrecently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours\\nbefore the overdose, can be valuable in determining what\\nwas taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system.\\nDifferent drugs have varying effects on the body’s\\nacid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood\\nlike potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to\\ndetect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to\\nwhat drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for\\nvarious drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is\\nidentified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast\\nthe drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can\\nalso be used to screen for some drugs and to detect\\nchanges in the body’s chemistry. Blood and urine tests\\nmay show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a\\nresult of the overdose.\\nTreatment\\nImmediate care\\nIf a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and\\nthe person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not\\nbreathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the\\nperson who took the drug is not having symptoms, don’t\\nwait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control\\ncenter immediately. Providing as much information as\\npossible to the poison control center can help determine\\nwhat the next course of action should be.\\nThe poison control center, paramedics, and emer-\\ngency room staff will want to know:\\n• what drug(s) were taken—try to locate the drug’s con-\\ntainer.\\n• how much of the drug was taken\\n• when was the drug taken\\n• was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or\\nchemicals\\n• what is the age of the patient\\n• what symptoms are the patient experiencing\\n• is the patient conscious\\n• is the patient breathing\\nThe poison control center may recommend trying to\\nget the patient to vomit.

If this is the case, and\\ndosages beyond normal then have to be prescribed, TDM\\ncan minimize the time that elapses.\\nTDM is important for patients who have other dis-\\neases that can affect drug levels, or who take other medi-\\ncines that may affect drug levels by interacting with the\\ndrug being tested. As an example, without drug monitor-\\ning, the physician cannot be sure if a patient’s lack of\\nresponse to an antibiotic reflects bacterial resistance, or\\nis the result of failure to reach the proper therapeutic\\nrange of antibiotic concentration in the blood. In cases of\\nlife-threatening infections, timing of effective antibiotic\\ntherapy is critical to success. It is equally crucial to avoid\\ntoxicity in a seriously ill patient. Therefore, if toxic\\nsymptoms appear with standard dosages, TDM can be\\nused to determine changes in dosing.\\nDrawn blood, used for TDM, demonstrates a drug\\naction in the body at any specific time, whereas drug lev-\\nels examined from urine samples reflect the presence of a\\ndrug over many days (depending on the rate of excre-\\ntion). Therefore, blood testing is the procedure of choice\\nwhen definite data are required. However, for adequate\\nabsorption and therapeutic levels to be accurate, it is\\nimportant to allow for sufficient time to pass between the\\nadministration of the medication and the collection of the\\nblood sample.\\nBlood specimens for drug monitoring can be taken\\nat two different times: during the drug’s highest thera-\\npeutic concentration (“peak” level), or its lowest\\n(“trough” level). Occasionally called residual levels,\\ntrough levels show sufficient therapeutic levels; whereas\\npeak levels show poisoning (toxicity). Peak and trough\\nlevels should fall within the therapeutic range.\\nPreparation\\nIn preparing for this test, the following guidelines\\nshould be observed:\\n• Depending on the drug to be tested, the physician\\nshould decide if the patient is to be fasting (nothing\\nto eat or drink for a specified period of hours) before\\nthe test.\\n• For patients suspected of symptoms of drug toxicity,\\nthe best time to draw the blood specimen is when the\\nsymptoms are occurring.\\n• If there is a question as to whether an adequate dose of\\nthe drug is being achieved, it is best to obtain trough\\n(lowest therapeutic concentration) levels.\\n• Peak (highest concentration) levels are usually obtained\\none to two hours after oral intake, approximately one\\nhour after intramuscular (IM) administration (a shot in\\nthe muscle), and approximately 30 minutes after intra-\\nvenous (IV) administration. Residual, or trough, levels\\nare usually obtained within 15 minutes of the next\\nscheduled dose.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1107\\nDrug therapy monitoring'),\n",

The pylorus connects the duode-\\nnum with the stomach and contains the valve that regu-\\nlates stomach emptying. Obstruction usually occurs right\\nat this outlet, so that the gall bladder and pancreas are\\nunable to drain their secretions without hindrance.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nObstruction of the duodenum occurs in adults and\\ninfants, each for a different set of reasons. In adults, the\\nusual cause is a peptic ulcer of such antiquity that repeat-\\ned cycles of injury and scarring have narrowed the pas-\\nsageway. Medical treatment of ulcers has progressed to\\nthe point where such obstinate ulcer disease is rarely\\nseen any more. In infants, the conditions are congeni-\\ntal—either the channel is underdeveloped or the pylorus\\nis overdeveloped. The first type is called duodenal\\nhypoplasia and the second is termed hypertrophic\\npyloric stenosis. In rare cases, the channel may be miss-\\ning altogether, a condition called duodenal atresia. To say\\nthat these anomalies are congenital is not to say their\\ncause is understood. As with most birth defects, the spe-\\ncific cause is not known.\\nFood that cannot exit the stomach in the forward\\ndirection will return whence it came. V omiting is the\\nconstant symptom of duodenal obstruction. It may be\\npreceded by indigestion and nausea as the stomach\\nattempts to squeeze its contents through an ever narrow-\\ning outlet.\\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis appears soon after\\nbirth. The infant will vomit feedings, lose weight, and be\\nrestless and irritable.\\nDiagnosis\\nX rays taken with contrast material in the stomach\\nreadily demonstrate the site of the blockage and often the\\nulcer that caused it. Gastroscopy is another way to evalu-\\nate the problem. In infants, x rays may not be necessary to\\ndetect pyloric stenosis. It is often possible to feel the\\nenlarged pylorus, like an olive, deep under the ribs and see\\nthe stomach rippling as it labors to force food through.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21110\\nDuodenal obstruction'),\n",

This\\nis probably related to a hormonal imbalance.\\nDUB is common in women who have polycystic\\novary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are\\non dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. So\\ndo some women who use an intrauterine device (IUD)\\nfor birth control.\\nDUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed-\\ning disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions.\\nMenorrhagia\\nMenorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is\\nanother term for abnormally long, heavy periods. This\\ntype of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many other\\ndiseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periods\\noccur regularly, but last more than seven days, and blood\\nloss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com-\\nmon. Between 15–20% of healthy women experience\\ndebilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normal\\nactivities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a serious\\nunderlying problem.\\nMetrorrhagia\\nMetrorrhagia is bleeding between menstrual periods.\\nBleeding is heavy and irregular as opposed to ovulatory\\nspotting which is light bleeding, in mid-cycle, at the time\\nof ovulation.\\nPolymenorrhea\\nPolymenorrhea describes the condition of having\\ntoo frequent periods. Periods occur more often than\\nevery 21 days, and ovulation usually does not occur dur-\\ning the cycle.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when\\nthe endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated to\\ngrow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro-\\ngen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog-\\nesterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out-\\ngrows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causing\\nirregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and\\nfrequent enough, anemia can result.\\nMenorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused\\nby many conditions including some outside the repro-\\nductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include:\\n• adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by\\ngrowths in the area of the uterus)\\n• imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges-\\nterone\\n• fibroid tumors\\n• pelvic infection\\n•endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous\\nmembrane of the uterus)\\n• endometrial polyps\\n•endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or\\nendrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normal\\nplace in the uterus)\\n• use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception\\n• hypothyroidism\\n• blood clotting problems (rare)\\n• lupus erythematosus\\n• pelvic inflammatory disease\\n• steroid therapy\\n• advanced liver disease\\n• renal (kidney) disease\\n• chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals)\\nTo diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of\\nthe potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat-\\ned. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy,\\ninfection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat-\\ned, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys-\\nfunctional uterine bleeding.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with\\nthe patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detailed\\ndescription of the problem, and take a history of how\\nlong it has existed, and any patterns the patient has\\nobserved. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosing\\nthe cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping a\\nrecord of the time, frequency, length, and quantity of\\nbleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill-\\nnesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes\\nmellitus.

A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal\\nfunction test are also commonly done.\\nImaging\\nImaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval-\\nuating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina-\\ntion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help\\nlocate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a\\ntype of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy—\\nwhere a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into\\nthe uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining—is\\nalso used to assess the condition of the uterus.\\nHystersalpingography can help outline endometrial\\npolyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer.\\nIn this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media\\nhas been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to\\nlocate fibroids and tumors.\\nInvasive procedures\\nEndometrial biopsy(the removal and examination\\nof endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce-\\ndure.

Older women are\\nlikely to need more extensive tests than adolescents\\nbecause the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater\\nin this age group, and therefore must be definitively\\neliminated before treating bleeding symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of DUB depends on the cause of the\\nbleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlying\\ncause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDilation and curettage (D & C) —A procedure\\nperformed under anesthesia during which the\\ncervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus is\\nscraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrument\\nor a suction tube. The procedure can be either\\ndiagnostic, or to remove polyps.\\nEndometrial biopsy—The removal of tissue either\\nby suction or scraping of samples of tissue from\\nthe uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedure\\nhas a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D &\\nC, but can be done as an office procedure under\\nlocal anesthesia.\\nEndometrial cancer—Cancer of the inner mucous\\nmembrane of the uterus.\\nFibroids, or fibroid tumors—Fibroid tumors are\\nnon-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus.\\nThey occur in 30–40% of women over age 40,\\nand do not need to be removed unless they are\\ncausing symptoms that interfere with a woman’s\\nnormal activities.\\nHypothyroidism—A disorder in which the thyroid\\ngland produces too little thyroid hormone causing\\na decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat-\\ned effects on the reproductive system.\\nLupus erythematosus—A chronic inflammatory\\ndisease in which inappropriate immune system\\nreactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels\\nand connective tissue.\\nProgesterone—A hormone naturally secreted by\\nthe ovary, or manufactured synthetically, that\\nprepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil-\\nized egg.\\nProstaglandins—A group of chemicals that medi-\\nate, or determine the actions of other chemicals in\\nthe cell or body.\\nOtherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp-\\ntoms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interfere\\nwith a woman’s normal activities or cause anemia.\\nGenerally the first approach to controlling DUB is to\\nuse oral contraceptives that provide a balance between\\nthe hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep-\\ntives are often very effective in adolescents and young\\nwomen in their twenties.

The prescription of iron is\\nalso important to decrease the risk of enemia.\\nUntil the 1980s, hysterectomy often was used to\\ntreat heavy uterine bleeding. Today hysterectomy is used\\nless frequently to treat DUB, and then only after other\\nmethods of controlling the symptoms have failed. A hys-\\nterectomy leaves a woman unable to bear children, and,\\ntherefore, is limited largely to women who are unable to,\\nor uninterested in, bearing children. Still, hysterectomy\\nis a common treatment for long-standing DUB in women\\ndone with childbearing.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative practitioners concentrate on good nutri-\\ntion as a way to prevent heavy periods that are not caused\\nby uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, or\\ncancer. Iron supplementation (100 mg per day) not only\\nhelps prevent anemia, but also appears to reduce menor-\\nrhagia in many women. Other recommended dietary sup-\\nplements include vitamins A and C. Vitamin C improves\\ncapillary fragility and enhances iron uptake.\\nVitamin E and bioflavonoid supplements are also\\nrecommended. Vitamin E can help reduce blood flow,\\nand bioflavonoids help strengthen the capillaries. Vita-\\nmin K is known to play a role in clotting and is helpful in\\nsituations where heavy bleeding may be due to clotting\\nabnormalities\\nBotanical medicines used to assist in treating abnor-\\nmal bleeding include spotted cranesbill (Geranium macu-\\nlatum), birthroot ( Trillium pendulum ), blue cohosh\\n(Caulophyllum thalictroides ), witch hazel ( Hamamelis\\nvirginiana), shepherd’s purse ( Capsella bursa-pastoris ),\\nand yarrow ( Achillea millifolia ). These are all stiptic\\nherbs that act to tighten blood vessels and tissue. Hor-\\nmonal balance can also be addressed with herbal formula-\\ntions containing phytoestrogens and phytoprogesterone.\\nPrognosis\\nResponse to treatment for DUB is highly individual\\nand is not easy to predict. The outcome depends largely\\non the woman’s medical condition and her age. Many\\nwomen, especially adolescents, are successfully treated\\nwith hormones (usually oral contraceptives). As a last\\nresort, hysterectomy removes the source of the problem\\nby removing the uterus, but this operation is not without\\nrisk, or the possibility of complications.\\nPrevention\\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is not a preventable\\ndisorder.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDeCherney, Alan H., and Martin L.

In many cases, dyslexia appears to be inherited.\\nDescription\\nThe word dyslexia is derived from the Greek word,\\ndys (meaning poor or inadequate) and the word lexis\\n(meaning words or language).\\nThe National Institutes of Health estimates that\\nabout 15% of the United States population is affected\\nby learning disabilities, mostly with problems in lan-\\nguage and reading. The condition appears in all ages,\\nraces, and income levels. Dyslexia is not a disease, but\\ndescribes rather a different kind of mind that learns in a\\ndifferent way from other people. Many people with the\\ncondition are gifted and very productive; dyslexia is not\\nat all linked to low intelligence. In fact, intelligence has\\nnothing to do with dyslexia.\\nDyslexic children seem to have trouble learning\\nearly reading skills, problems hearing individual sounds\\nin words, analyzing whole words in parts, and blending\\nsounds into words. Letters such as “d” and “b” may be\\nconfused.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21114\\nDyslexia'),\n",

Menstruating women of\\nany age can experience cramps.\\nWhile the pain may be only mild for some women,\\nothers experience severe discomfort that can significant-\\nly interfere with everyday activities for several days each\\nmonth.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDysmenorrhea is called “primary” when there is no\\nspecific abnormality, and “secondary” when the pain is\\ncaused by an underlying gynecological problem. It is\\nbelieved that primary dysmenorrhea occurs when hor-\\nmone-like substances called “prostaglandins” produced\\nby uterine tissue trigger strong muscle contractions in the\\nuterus during menstruation. However, the level of\\nprostaglandins doesn’t seem to have anything to do with\\nhow strong a woman’s cramps are. Some women have\\nhigh levels of prostaglandins and no cramps, whereas\\nother women with low levels have severe cramps. This is\\nwhy experts assume that cramps must also be related to\\nother things (such as genetics,stress, and different body\\ntypes) in addition to prostaglandins. The first year or two of\\na girl’s periods are not usually very painful. However, once\\novulation begins, the blood levels of the prostaglandins\\nrise, leading to stronger contractions.\\nSecondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by endo-\\nmetriosis, fibroid tumors, or an infection in the pelvis.\\nThe likelihood that a woman will have cramps\\nincreases if she:\\n• has a family history of painful periods\\n• leads a stressful life\\n• doesn’t get enough exercise\\n• uses caffeine\\n• has pelvic inflammatory disease\\nSymptoms include a dull, throbbing cramping in the\\nlower abdomen that may radiate to the lower back and\\nthighs. In addition, some women may experience nausea\\nand vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, sweating, or dizzi-\\nness. Cramps usually last for two or three days at the\\nbeginning of each menstrual period. Many women often\\nnotice their painful periods disappear after they have\\ntheir first child, probably due to the stretching of the\\nopening of the uterus or because the birth improves the\\nuterine blood supply and muscle activity.\\nDiagnosis\\nA doctor should perform a thorough pelvic exam\\nand take a patient history to rule out an underlying condi-\\ntion that could cause cramps.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEndometriosis —The growth of uterine tissue out-\\nside the uterus.\\nHormone—A chemical messenger secreted by a\\ngland and released into the blood, which allows it\\nto travel to distant cells where it exerts an effect.\\nOvary—One of the two almond-shaped glands in\\nthe female body that produces the hormones\\nestrogen and progesterone.\\nOvulation—The monthly release of an egg from\\nan ovary.\\nProgesterone—The hormone produced by the\\novary after ovulation that prepares the uterine lin-\\ning for a fertilized egg.\\nUterus—The female reproductive organ that con-\\ntains and nourishes a fetus from implantation until\\nbirth.\\nTreatment\\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is controlled by treating\\nthe underlying disorder.\\nSeveral drugs can lessen or completely eliminate\\nthe pain of primary dysmenorrhea. The most popular\\nchoice are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\n(NSAIDs), which prevent or decrease the formation of\\nprostaglandins. These include aspirin , ibuprofen\\n(Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). For more severe pain,\\nprescription strength ibuprofen (Motrin) is available.\\nThese drugs are usually begun at the first sign of the\\nperiod and taken for a day or two. There are many dif-\\nferent types of NSAIDs, and women may find that one\\nworks better for them than the others.\\nIf an NSAID is not available, acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol) may also help ease the pain. Heat applied to the\\npainful area may bring relief, and a warm bath twice a\\nday also may help. While birth control pills will ease the\\npain of dysmenorrhea because they lead to lower hor-\\nmone levels, they are not usually prescribed just for pain\\nmanagement unless the woman also wants to use them\\nas a birth control method. This is because these pills may\\ncarry other more significant side effects and risks.\\nNew studies of a drug patch containing glyceryl\\ntrinitrate to treat dysmenorrhea suggest that it also may\\nhelp ease pain.

Investigation of recurrent\\nindigestionshould rule out these possible causes.\\nOften, there is no organic cause for the problem, in\\nwhich case dyspepsia is classified as functional or nonul-\\ncer dyspepsia. There is evidence that functional dyspepsia\\nmay be related to abnormal motility of the upper gastroin-\\ntestinal tract (a state known as dysmotility in which the\\nesophagus, stomach, and upper intestine behave abnor-\\nmally). These patients may respond to a group of drugs\\ncalled prokinate agents. A review of eating habits (e.g.\\nchewing with the mouth open, gulping food, or talking\\nwhile chewing) may reveal a tendency to swallow air. This\\nmay contribute to feeling bloated, or to excessive belching.\\nSmoking, caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages may\\ncontribute to the discomfort. When there is sensitivity or\\nallergy to certain food substances, eating those foods may\\ncause gastrointestinal distress. Some medications are asso-\\nciated with indigestion.

An ear\\nexamination is a normal part of most physical examina-\\ntions by a doctor or nurse. It is also done when an ear\\ninfection or other type of ear problem is suspected.\\nPurpose\\nAn otoscope is used to look into the ear canal to see\\nthe ear drum. Redness or fluid in the eardrum can indi-\\ncate an ear infection. Some otoscopes can deliver a small\\npuff of air to the eardrum to see if the eardrum will\\nvibrate (which is normal). This type of ear examination\\nwith an otoscope can also detect a build up of wax in the\\near canal, or a rupture or puncture of the eardrum.\\nPrecautions\\nNo special precautions are required. However, if an\\near infection is present, an ear examination may cause\\nsome discomfort or pain.\\nDescription\\nAn ear examination with an otoscope is usually done\\nby a doctor or a nurse as part of a complete physical\\nexamination . The ears may also be examined if an ear\\ninfection is suspected due to fever, ear pain, or hearing\\nloss. The patient will often be asked to tip the head\\nslightly toward the shoulder so the ear to be examined is\\npointing up. The doctor or nurse may hold the ear lobe as\\nthe speculum is inserted into the ear, and may adjust the\\nposition of the otoscope to get a better view of the ear\\ncanal and eardrum. Both ears are usually examined, even\\nif there seems to be a problem with just one ear.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparation is required prior to an ear\\nexamination with an otoscope. The ear speculum, which\\nis inserted into the ear, is cleaned and sanitized before it\\nis used. The speculums come in various sizes, and the\\ndoctor or nurse will select the size that will be most com-\\nfortable for the patient’s ear.\\nAftercare\\nIf an ear infection is diagnosed, the patient may\\nrequire treatment with antibiotics. If there is a buildup of\\nwax in the ear canal, it might be rinsed or scraped out.\\nRisks\\nThis type of ear examination is simple and generally\\nharmless. Caution should always be used any time an\\nobject is inserted into the ear. This process could irritate\\nan infected external ear canal and could rupture an\\neardrum if performed improperly or if the patient moves.\\nNormal results\\nThe ear canal is normally skin-colored and is cov-\\nered with tiny hairs. It is normal for the ear canal to have\\nsome yellowish-brown earwax. The eardrum is typically\\nthin, shiny, and pearly-white to light gray in color.

Ear surgery is\\ncommonly performed to treat conductive hearing loss,\\npersistent ear infections, unhealed perforated eardrums,\\ncongenital ear defects, and tumors.\\nEar surgery is performed on children and adults. In\\nsome cases, surgery is the only treatment; in others, it is\\nused only when more conservative medical treatment fails.\\nPrecautions\\nThe precautions vary, depending on the type ofear\\nsurgery under consideration. For example, stapedecto-\\nmy (removal of parts of the middle ear and insertion of\\nprosthesis parts) should not be performed on people with\\nexternal or middle ear infection or inner ear disease. For\\npeople with complete hearing loss in the other ear, it\\nshould be performed cautiously. Microsurgery for the\\nremoval of a cholesteatoma (a cyst-like mass of cells in\\nthe middle ear) should not be performed on patients who\\nare extremely ill or have other medical conditions. Tym-\\npanoplasty (any surgical procedure on the eardrum or\\nmiddle ear) should not be performed on patients with\\nchronic sinus or nasal problems or in some patients with\\nmedical problems such as poorly controlled diabetes and\\nheart disease. Surgery for congenital microtia and atresia\\n(abscense of normal bodily openings, such as the outer\\near canal) should not be performed if the middle ear\\nspace is totally or almost totally absent.\\nDescription\\nMost ear surgery is microsurgery, performed with an\\noperating microscope to enable the surgeon to view the\\nvery small structures of the ear. The use of minimally\\ninvasive laser surgery for middle ear procedures is\\ngrowing. Laser surgery reduces the amount of trauma\\ndue to vibration, enhances coagulation, and enables sur-\\ngeons to access hard to reach places in the middle ear.\\nLaser surgery can be performed in an office operating\\nsuite. Types of ear surgery include stapedectomy, tym-\\npanoplasty, myringotomy and ear tube surgery, ear\\nsurgery to repair a perforated eardrum , cochlear\\nimplants, and tumor removal.\\nStapedectomy\\nTo restore hearing loss, which is usually due to oto-\\nsclerosis, stapedectomy is performed. Stapedectomy is\\nthe removal of all or part of the stapes, one of the bones in\\nthe middle ear, and replacement with a tiny prosthesis. An\\nincision is made in the middle ear, the small bones are\\nidentified, and the stapes is removed.

Performed\\nin a hospital or outpatient surgical facility under local or\\ngeneral anesthetic, full recovery takes about three weeks\\nbut hearing should improve immediately.\\nTympanoplasty\\nTympanoplasty is performed to reconstruct the\\neardrum after partial or total conductive hearing loss,\\nusually caused by chronic middle ear infections, or per-\\nforations that do not heal. This is usually a same day\\nsurgery, performed under either local or general anesthe-\\nsia. After making an incision in the ear to view the perfo-\\nration, the ear drum is elevated away from the ear canal\\nand lifted forward. If the bones of hearing (ossicular\\nchain) are functioning, tissue is taken from the ear and\\ngrafted to the eardrum to close the perforation. A thin\\nsheet of silastic and Gelfoam hold the graft in place. The\\near is stitched together, and a sterile patch is placed on\\nthe outside of the ear canal. Tympanoplasty is successful\\nin over 90% of all cases. The need for ossicular recon-\\nstruction (reconstruction of tiny bones of the middle ear)\\nis sometimes known before surgery and and even when\\nidentified during surgery, can usually be done while\\nreconstructing the eardrum. If the gap between the anvil\\nbone and the stapes is small, a small piece of bone or car-\\ntilage from the patient can be inserted; if is is large, the\\nincus bone is removed, modelled into a prosthesis, and\\nreinserted between the stapes and the malleus. Recon-\\nstruction could also be achieved by inserting a strut made\\nfrom artificial bone. For tympanoplasty with ossicular\\nreconstruction, the patient usually stays in the hospital\\novernight. The recovery period is about four weeks.\\nMyringotomy and ear tube surgery\\nMyringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to\\ndrain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi-\\notics don’t work or when ear infections are chronic. The\\nprocess normalizes pressure in the middle ear and\\ndecreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per-\\nformed on infants and children, in whom ear infections\\nare most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears.\\nThe surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, then\\nuses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal or\\nplastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continual\\ndrainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it stays\\nin place, which varies from six months to three years.\\nWhen the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of\\n25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubes\\nmay need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery\\nis performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic for\\nmost children and a local anesthetic for older children or\\nadults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce-\\ndure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can go\\nhome the same day; children under three years of age and\\nthose with chronic diseases usually stay overnight.\\nEar surgery for a perforated eardrum\\nEar surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per-\\nformed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. In\\nmost cases, this is performed in a surgeon’s office using a\\ntopical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur-\\nface of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and the\\neardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum’s\\nouter surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal.\\nCochlear implants\\nCochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the\\ninner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has a\\nmicrophone that remains outside the ear, a processor that\\nselects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulator\\nto convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulate\\nthe hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound.\\nDuring surgery, an incision is made behind and slightly\\nabove the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receive\\nthe device’s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to the\\nmiddle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internal\\ncoil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. The\\nwound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unit\\ncomprised of a stimulator with a microphone is worn\\nbehind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes-\\nthesia, the operation takes about two hours and usually\\nrequires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resume\\nnormal activities in two to three weeks.\\nEar surgery for tumors\\nSome ear tumors can be very serious and should be\\nremoved surgically.

A skin graft is placed on the bare\\nbone. For basal cell cancers and low grade glandular\\nmalignancies, surgical resection of the ear canal is ade-\\nquate. Squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form of can-\\ncer, of the external ear canal requires radical surgery, fol-\\nlowed by radiation therapy . Cholesteatoma, a benign\\ntumor caused by an infection in a perforated eardrum that\\ndid not heal properly and can destroy the bones of hear-\\ning, is removed with microsurgery. Mastoidectomy is\\nperformed for mastoiditis, an inflammation of the mid-\\ndle ear, if medical therapy does not work. Petrous apicec-\\ntomy is performed to drain the petrous apicitis, the bone\\nbetween the middle ear and the clivis.\\nEar surgery for congenital ear defects\\nCongenital atresia, the absence of the external ear\\ncanal, and congenital microtia, abnormal growth of the\\nexternal ear, often occur together, although atresia can\\noccur without microtia. Surgery to reconstruct the ear\\nusually takes place when the child is four or five years old\\nand may require several operations. A facial plastic sur-\\ngeon and an ear surgeon work together, repairing the\\nmicrotia first and then the atresia. During surgery, a bony\\nopening is created over the bones of hearing. The surfaces\\nof the bony ear canal are then relined with a skin graft\\nfrom the thigh or abdomen. Tissue from behind the\\neardrum is used to create a new eardrum. In many cases,\\nthe middle ear will also need to be reconstructed.

Most often referred to as the purple coneflower,\\nthis hardy plant also known as Sampson root, Missouri\\nsnakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent, bristly seed\\nhead inspired the generic name of the plant, taken from\\nthe Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog.\\nDescription\\nEchinacea is a North American prairie native, abun-\\ndant in the Midwest, and cultivated widely in ornamental\\nand medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos-\\nsom droop downward from a brassy hued center cone\\ncomposed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu-\\nous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems from\\nmid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in\\n(10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite,\\nentire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi-\\nnent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to the\\nstem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emerging\\nfrom the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in\\n(20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender,\\nblack roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or by\\nroot cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularity\\nas an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered among\\nthe 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the Vermont\\nnonprofit organization, United Plant Savers.\\nPurpose\\nThree species of echinacea are useful medicinally:\\nEchinacea augustifolia, Echinacea purpurea , and Echi-\\nnacea pallida . The entire plant has numerous medicinal\\nproperties that act synergistically to good effect. Echi-\\nnacea is most often used to boost the immune system and\\nfight infection. Research has shown that echinacea\\nincreases production of interferon in the body. It is anti-\\nseptic and antimicrobial, with properties that act to\\nincrease the number of white blood cells available to\\ndestroy bacteria and slow the spread of infection. As a\\ndepurative, the herbal extract cleanses and purifies the\\nbloodstream, and has been used effectively to treat boils.\\nEchinacea is vulnerary, promoting wound healing through\\nthe action of a chemical substance in the root known as\\ncaffeic acid glycoside. As an alterative and an immuno-\\nmodulator, echinacea acts gradually to promote beneficial\\nchange in the entire system. It has also been used to treat\\nurinary infection and Candida albicans infections. Echi-\\nnacea is a febrifuge, useful in reducing fevers. It is also\\nuseful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. A tincture, or a\\nstrong decoction of echinacea serves as an effective\\nmouthwash for the treatment of pyorrhea and gingivitis.\\nNative American plains Indians relied on echinacea\\nas an all-purpose antiseptic. The Sioux tribe valued the\\nroot as a remedy for snake bite, the Cheyenne tribe\\nchewed the root to quench thirst, and another tribe\\nwashed their hands in a decoction of echinacea to\\nincrease their tolerance of heat. European settlers learned\\nof the North American herb’s many uses, and soon\\nnumerous echinacea-based remedies were commercially\\navailable from pharmaceutical companies in the United\\nStates. Echinacea was a popular remedy in the United\\nStates through the 1930s. It was among many medicinal\\nherbs listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the official Unit-\\ned States government listing of pharmaceutical raw\\nmaterials and recipes. The herb fell out of popular use in\\nthe United States with the availability of antibiotics . In\\nWest Germany, over 200 preparations are made from the\\nspecies E. purpurea. Commercially prepared salves, tinc-\\ntures, teas, and extracts are marketed using standardized\\nextracts. Echinacea is regaining its status in the United\\nStates as a household medicine-chest staple in many\\nhomes. It is one of the best-selling herbal supplements in\\nUnited States health food stores.\\nClinical studies have found that the entire plant pos-\\nsesses medicinal properties with varying levels of effec-\\ntiveness. Echinacea is of particular benefit in the treatment\\nof upper respiratory tract infections. Some research has\\nshown that echinacea activates the macrophages that\\ndestroy cancer cells and pathogens. When taken after can-\\ncer treatments, an extract of the root has been found to\\nincrease the body’s production of white blood cells. Echi-\\nnacea has been shown to be most effective when taken at\\nthe first sign of illness, rather than when used as a daily\\npreventative.

Echocardiography may show such abnormalities\\nas poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the heart\\ntissue from a past heart attack.\\nPurpose\\nEchocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio-\\nvascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely used\\ndiagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealth\\nof helpful information, including the size and shape of the\\nheart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent of\\nany damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess-\\ning diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctors\\nto evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalities\\nin the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow of\\nblood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur-\\ngitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall,\\nechocardiography can help detect the presence and assess\\nthe severity of coronary artery disease , as well as help\\ndetermine whether any chest pain is related to heart dis-\\nease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic\\ncardiomyopathy, in which the walls of the heart thicken\\nin an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness.\\nThe biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is\\nnoninvasive (doesn’t involve breaking the skin or entering\\nbody cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\\nPrecautions\\nEchocardiography is an extremely safe procedure\\nand no special precautions are required.\\nDescription\\nEchocardiography creates an image of the heart\\nusing ultra-high-frequency sound waves—sound waves\\nthat are too high in frequency to be heard by the human\\near. The technique is very similar to ultrasound scanning\\ncommonly used to visualize the fetus during pregnancy.\\nAn echocardiography examination generally lasts\\nbetween 15–30 minutes. The patient lies bare-chested on\\nan examination table. A special gel is spread over the\\nchest to help the transducer make good contact and slide\\nsmoothly over the skin. The transducer, a small hand-held\\ndevice at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against the\\nchest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducer\\ndirects ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of the\\nwaves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer.\\nSince different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasound\\nwaves differently, these sound waves can be translated\\ninto a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis-\\nplayed on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. The\\npatient does not feel the sound waves, and the entire pro-\\ncedure is painless. In fact, there are no known side effects.\\nOccasionally, variations of the echocardiography\\ntest are used. For example, Doppler echocardiography\\nemploys a special microphone that allows technicians to\\nmeasure and analyze the direction and speed of blood\\nflow through blood vessels and heart valves. This makes\\nit especially useful for detecting and evaluating regurgi-\\ntation through the heart valves. By assessing the speed of\\nblood flow at different locations around an obstruction, it\\ncan also help to precisely locate the obstruction.\\nAn exercise echocardiogram is an echocardiogram\\nperformed during exercise, when the heart muscle must\\nwork harder to supply blood to the body. This allows\\ndoctors to detect heart problems that might not be evi-\\ndent when the body is at rest and needs less blood.

The\\nword ectopic means “in an abnormal place or position.” The\\nmost common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor-\\nmally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However,\\nectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen,\\nand the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to the\\nvaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg-\\nnancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy refer\\nto the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy.\\nDescription\\nOnce a month, an egg is produced in a woman’s ovary\\nand travels down the fallopian tube where it meets the\\nmale’s sperm and is fertilized. In a normal pregnancy the\\nfertilized egg, or zygote, continues on its passage down the\\nfallopian tube and enters the uterus in three to five days.\\nThe zygote continues to grow, implanting itself securely in\\nthe wall of the uterus.

The fallopian tube is too narrow for the\\ngrowing zygote. Eventually the thin walls of the tube\\nstretch and may burst (rupture), resulting in severe bleed-\\ning and possibly the death of the mother. More than 95%\\npercent of all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian\\ntube. Only 1.5% develop in the abdomen; less than 1%\\ndevelop in the ovary or the cervix.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs many as 50% of women with ectopic pregnancies\\nhave a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\\nThis is an infection of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis)\\nthat can spread to the uterus or ovaries. It is most com-\\nmonly caused by the organisms Gonorrhea and Chlamy-\\ndia and is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse.\\nOther conditions also increase the risk of ectopic\\npregnancy. They include:\\n•Endometriosis . A condition in which the tissue that\\nnormally lines the uterus is found outside the uterus,\\nand can block a fallopian tube.\\n• Exposure to diethylsilbestrol (DES) as a fetus. If a\\nwoman’s mother took DES (a synthetic version of the\\nhormone estrogen) during pregnancy, the woman may\\nhave abnormalities in her fallopian tubes that can make\\nectopic pregnancy more likely.\\n• Taking hormones. Estrogen and progesterone are hor-\\nmones that regulate the menstrual cycle and may be in\\nmedications prescribed by a doctor for birth control or\\nother reasons. Taking these hormones can affect the inte-\\nrior lining of the fallopian tubes and slow the movement\\nof the fertilized egg down the tube. Women who become\\npregnant in spite of taking some progesterone-only con-\\ntraceptives have a greater chance of an ectopic pregnan-\\ncy. Ectopic pregnancy is also more likely when the\\novaries are artificially stimulated with hormones to pro-\\nduce eggs for in vitro fertilization(a procedure in which\\neggs are taken from a woman’s body, fertilized, and then\\nplaced in the uterus in an attempt to conceive a child).\\n• Use of an intrauterine device ( IUD). These contracep-\\ntive devices are designed to prevent fertilized eggs from\\nbecoming implanted in the uterus, but they have only a\\nminimal effect on preventing ectopic pregnancies.\\nTherefore, if a woman becomes pregnant while using\\nan IUD for contraception , the fertilized egg is more\\nlikely to be implanted someplace other than the uterus.\\nFor example, among women who become pregnant\\nwhile using a progesterone-bearing IUD, about 15%\\nhave ectopic pregnancies.\\n• Surgery on a fallopian tube. The risk of ectopic preg-\\nnancy can be as high as 60% after undergoing elective\\ntubal sterilization, a procedure in which the fallopian\\ntubes are severed to prevent pregnancy. Women who\\nhave successful surgery to reverse the procedure are\\nalso more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.\\nEarly symptoms\\nIn an ectopic pregnancy all the hormonal changes\\nassociated with a normal pregnancy may occur. The early\\nsymptoms include:fatigue; nausea; a missed period; breast\\ntenderness; low back pain; mild cramping on one side of\\nthe pelvis; and abnormal vaginal bleeding, usually spotting.\\nLater symptoms\\nAs the embryo grows too large for the confined\\nspace in the tube, the first sign that something is wrong\\nmay be a stabbing pain in the pelvis or abdomen. If the\\ntube has ruptured, blood may irritate the diaphragm and\\ncause shoulder pain. Other warning signs are lighthead-\\nedness and fainting.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo confirm an early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy,\\nthe doctor must determine first that the patient is preg-\\nnant and that the location of the embryo is outside the\\nuterus.

The circulatory system\\ntransports fluid within the body via its network of blood\\nvessels. The fluid, which contains oxygen and nutrients\\nneeded by the cells, moves from the walls of the blood\\nvessels into the body’s tissues. After its nutrients are used\\nup, fluid moves back into the blood vessels and returns to\\nthe heart. The lymphatic system (a network of channels\\nin the body that carry lymph, a colorless fluid containing\\nwhite blood cells to fight infection) also absorbs and\\ntransports this fluid. In edema, either too much fluid\\nmoves from the blood vessels into the tissues, or not\\nenough fluid moves from the tissues back into the blood\\nvessels. This fluid imbalance can cause mild to severe\\nswelling in one or more parts of the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany ordinary factors can upset the balance of fluid\\nin the body to cause edema, including:\\n• Immobility.

For this reason, it is also called trisomy 18\\nsyndrome. The extra chromosome is lethal for most babies\\nborn with this condition. It causes major physical abnor-\\nmalities and severe mental retardation, and very few chil-\\ndren afflicted with this disease survive beyond a year.\\nDescription\\nHumans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes.\\nChromosomes are numbered 1–22, and the 23rd pair is\\ncomposed of the sex chromosomes, X and Y . A person\\ninherits one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent.\\nOccasionally, a genetic error occurs during egg or\\nsperm cell formation. A child conceived with such an\\negg or sperm cell may inherit an incorrect number of\\nchromosomes.\\nIn the case of Edwards’ syndrome, the child inherits\\nthree, rather than two, copies of chromosome 18. Trisomy\\n18 occurs in approximately one in every 3,000 newborns\\nand affects girls more often than boys. Women older than\\ntheir early thirties have a greater risk of conceiving a child\\nwith trisomy 18, but it can occur in younger women.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA third copy of chromosome 18 causes numerous\\nabnormalities. Most children born with Edwards’ syn-\\ndrome appear weak and fragile, and they are often under-\\nweight. The head is unusually small and the back of the\\nhead is prominent. The ears are malformed and low-set,\\nand the mouth and jaw are small. The baby may also\\nhave a cleft lip or cleft palate. Frequently, the hands are\\nclenched into fists, and the index finger overlaps the\\nother fingers. The child may have clubfeet and toes may\\nbe webbed or fused.\\nNumerous problems involving the internal organs\\nmay be present. Abnormalities often occur in the lungs\\nand diaphragm (the muscle that controls breathing), and\\nheart defects and blood vessel malformations are com-\\nmon. The child may also have malformed kidneys and\\nabnormalities of the urogenital system.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysical abnormalities point to Edwards’ syndrome,\\nbut definitive diagnosis relies on karyotyping. Karyotyp-\\ning involves drawing the baby’s blood or bone marrow\\nfor a microscopic examination of the chromosomes.\\nUsing special stains and microscopy, individual chromo-\\nsomes are identified, and the presence of an extra chro-\\nmosome 18 is revealed.\\nTrisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg-\\nnant woman is older than 35, has a family history of\\ngenetic abnormalities, has previously conceived a child\\nwith a genetic abnormality, or has suffered earlier miscar-\\nriages, she may undergo tests to determine whether her\\nchild carries genetic abnormalities. Potential tests include\\nmaternal serum analysis or screening, ultrasonography,\\namniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for Edwards’ syndrome. Since tri-\\nsomy 18 babies frequently have major physical abnor-\\nmalities, doctors and parents face difficult choices\\nregarding treatment. Abnormalities can be treated to a\\ncertain degree with surgery, but extreme invasive proce-\\ndures may not be in the best interests of an infant whose\\nlifespan is measured in days or weeks. Medical therapy\\noften consists of supportive care with the goal of making\\nthe infant comfortable, rather than prolonging life.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1136\\nEdwards’ syndrome'),\n",

The many roles of\\ncollagen are reflected in the number of genes dedicated\\nto its production. There are at least 28 genes in humans\\nthat encode at least 19 different types of collagen. Muta-\\ntions in these genes can affect basic construction as well\\nas the fine-tuned processing of the collagen.\\nEDS was originally described by Dr. Van Meekeren\\nin 1682. Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Danlos further characterized\\nthe disease in 1901 and 1908, respectively. Today,\\naccording to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, one\\nin 5,000 to one in 10,000 people are affected by some\\nform of EDS.\\nEDS is a group of genetic disorders that usually\\naffects the skin, ligaments, joints, and blood vessels. Clas-\\nsification of EDS types was revised in 1997. The new\\nclassification involves categorizing the different forms of\\nEDS into six major sub-types, including classical, hyper-\\nmobility, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia, and\\ndermatosparaxis, and a collection of rare or poorly\\ndefined varieties. This new classification is simpler and\\nbased more on descriptions of the actual symptoms.\\nClassical type\\nUnder the old classification system, EDS classical\\ntype was divided into two separate types: type I and type\\nII. The major symptoms involved in EDS classical type\\nare the skin and joints. The skin has a smooth, velvety\\ntexture and bruises easily. Affected individuals typically\\nhave extensive scaring, particularly at the knees, elbows,\\nforehead, and chin. The joints are hyperextensible, giving\\na tendency towards dislocation of the hip, shoulder,\\nelbow, knee, or clavicle. Due to decreased muscle tone,\\naffected infants may experience a delay in reaching motor\\nmilestones. Children may have a tendency to develop her-\\nnias or other organ shifts within the abdomen. Sprains and\\npartial or complete joint dilocations are also common.\\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe. EDS classical\\ntype is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\\nThere are three major clinical diagnostic criteria for\\nEDS classical type. These include skin hyperextensibili-\\nty, unusually wide scars, and joint hypermobility. At this\\ntime there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of classi-\\ncal EDS. Both DNA and biochemical studies have been\\nused to help identify affected individuals. In some cases,\\na skin biopsy has been found to be useful in confirming\\na diagnosis. Unfortunately, these tests are not sensitive\\nenough to identify all individuals with classical EDS. If\\nthere are multiple affected individuals in a family, it may\\nbe possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNA\\ninformation technique known as a linkage study.\\nHypermobility type\\nExcessively loose joints are the hallmark of this EDS\\ntype, formerly known as EDS type III. Both large joints,\\nsuch as the elbows and knees, and small joints, such as\\ntoes and fingers, are affected. Partial and total joint dislo-\\ncations are common, and particularly involve the jaw,\\nknee, and shoulder. Many individuals experience chronic\\nlimb and joint pain, although x rays of these joints appear\\nnormal. The skin may also bruise easily. Osteoarthritis is\\na common occurrence in adults. EDS hypermobility type\\nis inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\\nThere are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for\\nEDS hypermobility type. These include skin involvement\\n(either hyperextensible skin or smooth and velvety skin)\\nand generalized joint hypermobility. At this time there is\\nno test for this form of EDS.\\nV ascular type\\nFormerly called EDS type IV , EDS vascular type is\\nthe most severe form. The connective tissue in the\\nintestines, arteries, uterus, and other hollow organs may\\nbe unusually weak, leading to organ or blood vessel rup-\\nture. Such ruptures are most likely between ages 20 and\\n40, although they can occur any time, and may be life-\\nthreatening.\\nThere is a classic facial appearance associated with\\nEDS vascular type. Affected individuals tend to have\\nlarge eyes, a thin pinched nose, thin lips, and a slim body.\\nThe skin is thin and translucent, with veins dramatically\\nvisible, particularly across the chest.\\nThe large joints have normal stability, but small\\njoints in the hands and feet are loose, showing hyperex-\\ntensibility. The skin bruises easily. Other complications\\nmay include collapsed lungs, premature aging of the skin\\non the hands and feet, and ruptured arteries and veins.\\nAfter surgery there tends to be poor wound healing, a\\ncomplication that tends to be frequent and severe. Preg-\\nnancy also carries the risk complications. During and\\nafter pregnancy there is an increased risk of the uterus\\nrupturing and of arterial bleeding. Due to the severe com-\\nplications associated with EDS type IV ,death usually\\noccurs before the fifth decade. A study of 419 individuals\\nwith EDS vascular type, completed in 2000, found that\\nthe median survival rate was 48 years, with a range of six\\nto 73 years. EDS vascular type is inherited in an autoso-\\nmal dominant manner.\\nThere are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for\\nEDS vascular type. These include thin translucent skin,\\narterial/intestinal/uterine fragility or rupture, extensive\\nbruising, and characteristic facial appearance.

At\\nbirth, the muscle tone is poor, and motor skill develop-\\nment is subsequently delayed. Also, infants with this type\\nof EDS have an abnormal curvature of the spine (scolio-\\nsis). The scoliosis becomes progressively worse with\\nage, with affected individuals usually unable to walk by\\nage 20. The eyes and skin are fragile and easily damaged,\\nand blood vessel involvement is a possibility. The bones\\nmay also be affected as demonstrated by a decrease in\\nbone mass.

These include generaly loose\\njoints, low muscle tone at birth, scoliosis at birth (which\\nworsens with age), and a fragility of the eyes, which may\\ngive the white area of the eye a blue tint or cause the eye\\nto rupture.

The skin has a high degree\\nof stretchability and bruises easily. Individuals with this\\ntype of EDS may also experience mildly diminished\\nbone mass, scoliosis, and poor muscle tone. Arthrochala-\\nsia type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\\nThere are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for\\nEDS arthrochalasia type. These include sever general-\\nized joing hypermobility and bilateral hip dislocation\\npresent at birth.

Solis, MS\\nEhrlichiosis\\nDefinition\\nEhrlichiosis is a bacterial infection that is spread by\\nticks. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle\\naches, and tiredness.\\nDescription\\nEhrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by infec-\\ntion with Ehrlichia bacteria. Ticks are small, blood-suck-\\ning arachnids. Although some ticks carry disease-causing\\norganisms, most do not. When an animal or person is bit-\\nten by a tick that carries bacteria, the bacteria are passed\\nto that person or animal during the tick’s feeding process.\\nIt is believed that the tick must remain attached to the\\nperson or animal for at least 24 hours to spread the infec-\\ntion.\\nThere are two forms of ehrlichiosis in the United\\nStates; human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human gran-\\nulocytic ehrlichiosis. Monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused\\nby Ehrlichia chaffeensis , which is spread by the Lone\\nStar tick, Amblyomma americanum . As of early 1998,\\nabout 400 cases of monocytic ehrlichiosis had been\\nreported in 30 states, primarily in the southeastern and\\nsouth central United States. The bacteria that causes\\ngranulocytic ehrlichiosis is not known, but suspected to\\nbe either Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila .\\nGranulocytic ehrlichiosis is probably spread by the\\nblacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (which also spreads\\nLyme disease ). About 100 cases of granulocytic ehrli-\\nchiosis have been reported in Connecticut, Massachu-\\nsetts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New York, and Wiscon-\\nsin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBoth forms of ehrlichiosis have similar symptoms,\\nand the illnesses can range from mild to severe and life-\\nthreatening. Risk factors include old age and exposure to\\nticks through work or recreation. Symptoms occur seven\\nto 21 days following a tick bite although patients may not\\nrecall being bitten. Fever, tiredness, headache, muscle\\naches, chills, loss of appetite, confusion, nausea, and\\nvomiting are common to both diseases. A rash may\\noccur.\\nDiagnosis\\nEhrlichiosis may be diagnosed and treated by doc-\\ntors who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) or\\nan infectious disease specialist. Because ehrlichiosis is\\nnot very common and the symptoms are not unique, it\\nmay be misdiagnosed. A recent history of a tick bite is\\nhelpful in the diagnosis. Blood tests will be done to look\\nfor antibodies to Ehrlichia . Staining and microscopic\\nexamination of the blood sample may show Ehrlichia\\nbacteria inside white blood cells. Another test, called\\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a very sensitive\\nassay to detect bacteria in the blood sample, but it is not\\nalways available.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotic treatment should begin immediately if\\nehrlichiosis is suspected, even if laboratory results are\\nnot available. Treatment with either tetracycline\\n(Sumycin, Achromycin V) or doxycycline (Monodox,\\nVibramycin) is recommended. Many patients with ehrli-\\nchiosis are admitted to the hospital for treatment.\\nPrognosis\\nFor otherwise healthy people, a full recovery is\\nexpected following treatment for ehrlichiosis. Elderly\\npatients are at a higher risk for severe disease, which may\\nbe fatal. Serious complications include lung or gastroin-\\ntestinal bleeding. Two to 10 patients out of 100 die from\\nthe disease.\\nPrevention\\nThe only prevention for ehrlichiosis is to minimize\\nexposure to ticks by staying on the trail when walking\\nthrough the woods, avoiding tall grasses, wearing long\\nsleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, wearing insect\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1142\\nEhrlichiosis'),\n",

The interplay of these factors can produce effects\\nranging from barely noticeable tingling to instant death;\\nevery part of the body is vulnerable. Although the severi-\\nKEY TERMS\\nTick-borne disease —A disease that is spread to\\nanimals by the bite of an infected tick.\\nty of injury is determined primarily by the voltage, low\\nvoltage can be just as dangerous as high voltage under\\nthe right circumstances. People have been killed by\\nshocks of just 50 volts.\\nHow electric shocks affect the skin is determined by\\nthe skin’s resistance, which in turn is dependent upon the\\nwetness, thickness, and cleanliness of the skin. Thin or wet\\nskin is much less resistant than thick or dry skin. When\\nskin resistance is low, the current may cause little or no\\nskin damage but severely burn internal organs and tissues.\\nConversely, high skin resistance can produce severe skin\\nburnsbut prevent the current from entering the body.\\nThe nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, and\\nnerves) is particularly vulnerable to injury. In fact, neuro-\\nlogical problems are the most common kind of nonlethal\\nharm suffered by electric shock victims. Some neurological\\ndamage is minor and clears up on its own or with medical\\ntreatment, but some is severe and permanent. Neurological\\nproblems may be apparent immediately after the accident,\\nor gradually develop over a period of up to three years.\\nDamage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems\\nis most acute at the moment of injury. Electric shocks can\\nparalyze the respiratory system or disrupt heart action,\\ncausing instant death. Also at risk are the smaller veins and\\narteries, which dissipate heat less easily than the larger\\nblood vessels and can develop blood clots. Damage to the\\nsmaller vessels is probably one reason why amputation is\\noften required following high-voltage injuries.\\nMany other sorts of injuries are possible after an\\nelectric shock, including cataracts , kidney failure, and\\nsubstantial destruction of muscle tissue. The victim may\\nsuffer a fall or be hit by debris from exploding equip-\\nment. An electric arc may set clothing or nearby flamma-\\nble substances on fire. Strong shocks are often accompa-\\nnied by violent muscle spasms that can break and dislo-\\ncate bones. These spasms can also freeze the victim in\\nplace and prevent him or her from breaking away from\\nthe source of the current.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis relies on gathering information about the\\ncircumstances of the accident, a thorough physical exami-\\nnation, and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney activ-\\nity. The victim’s neurological condition can fluctuate rapid-\\nly and requires close observation. A computed tomography\\nscan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\nmay be necessary to check for brain injury.\\nTreatment\\nWhen an electric shock accident happens at home or\\nin the workplace, the main power should immediately be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1143\\nElectric shock injuries'),\n",

If that cannot be done, and current is still flowing\\nthrough the victim, the alternative is to stand on a dry, non-\\nconducting surface such as a folded newspaper, flattened\\ncardboard carton, or plastic or rubber mat and use a non-\\nconducting object such as a wooden broomstick (never a\\ndamp or metallic object) to push the victim away from the\\nsource of the current. The victim and the source of the cur-\\nrent must not be touched while the current is still flowing,\\nfor this can electrocute the rescuer. Emergency medical\\nhelp should be summoned as quickly as possible. People\\nwho are trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscita-\\ntion (CPR) should, if appropriate, begin first aid while\\nwaiting for emergency medical help to arrive.\\nBurn victims usually require treatment at a burn cen-\\nter.

The record, which is called an electrocardiogram\\n(ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to\\nthe electrical impulses which occur during each beat of\\nthe heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed\\non a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P,\\nQ, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num-\\nber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present.\\nPurpose\\nElectrocardiography is a starting point for detecting\\nmany cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical\\nexaminations and for monitoring the patient’s condition\\nduring and after surgery, as well as during intensive care.\\nIt is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise\\ntolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such\\nas chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations.\\nPrecautions\\nNo special precautions are required.\\nDescription\\nThe patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec-\\ntrodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif-\\nic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the\\nelectrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be\\nemployed.\\nMuscle movement may interfere with the recording,\\nwhich lasts for several beats of the heart.

These electrical\\nimpulses travel through specialized cells that form a con-\\nduction system. Following this pathway ensures that con-\\ntractions will occur in a coordinated manner.\\nWhen the presence of all waves is observed in the\\nelectrocardiogram and these waves follow the order\\ndefined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normal\\nsinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol-\\nlowing the regular conduction pathway.\\nThe heart is described as showing arrhythmia or dys-\\nrhythmia when time intervals between waves, the order,\\nor the number of waves do not fit this pattern. Other fea-\\ntures that may be altered include the direction of wave\\ndeflection and wave widths.\\nIn the normal heart, electrical impulses—at a rate of\\n60–100 times per minute—originate in the sinus node.\\nThe sinus node is located in the first chamber, known as\\nthe right atrium, where blood re-enters the heart. After\\ntraveling down to the junction between the upper and\\nlower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricular\\nnode. From here, after a delay, it passes by specialized\\nroutes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In many\\ndisease states, the passage of the electrical impulse can\\nbe interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart to\\nperform less efficiently.\\nAbnormal results\\nSpecial training is required for interpretation of the\\nelectrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter-\\npretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro-\\ncardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria.\\nThe QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associated\\nwith ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming after\\nthe contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives a\\nvalue for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel\\nfrom the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec).\\nThe cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic\\nbeats are premature heart beats that arise from a site\\nother than the sinus node—commonly from the atria,\\natrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys-\\nrhythmias are only occasional, they may produce no\\nsymptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or “flip-\\nflopping” may be experienced. These occasional dys-\\nrhythmias are common in healthy people, but they also\\ncan be an indication of heart disease.\\nThe varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide\\nrange of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram.\\nEctopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor-\\nmal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associated\\nwith insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardial\\nischemia). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco-\\nordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con-\\ndition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, P\\nwaves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat-\\nic intervals, or “irregularly irregular.”\\nWhen the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a\\ncondition known as heart block results. If this is partial,\\nthe P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven-\\ntricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde-\\npendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, and\\nthe QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAtwood, Sandra, et al.

Grant\\nElectroconvulsive therapy\\nDefinition\\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat-\\nment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully\\ncontrolled amount of electricity is introduced into the\\nbrain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with\\nanesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a\\nmild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat\\na variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the\\ntreatment of severe depression, and provides the most\\nrapid relief currently available for this illness.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide\\nrelief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses\\nsuch as severe depression,mania, and schizophrenia.\\nECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement\\nbecause they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or\\ndrink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or\\npresent some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant\\nmedications, while effective in many cases, may take two\\nto six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic\\nmedications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have\\nmany uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side\\neffects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel-\\nop allergiesand therefore are unable to take their medicine.\\nPrecautions\\nThe most common risks associated with ECT are\\ndisturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bones\\noccur very rarely.\\nDescription\\nThe treatment of severe mental illness, such as\\nschizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was\\nintroduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti\\nand Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con-\\nvulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since,\\naccording to their obervations, this disease rarely\\noccurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They\\nconcluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi-\\ncally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness\\ncould be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari-\\nety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their\\npatients died or suffered severe injuries because the\\nstrength of the convulsions could not be well controlled.\\nElectroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro-\\nversial of all procedures used to treat mental illness.\\nWhen it was first introduced, many people were fright-\\nened simply because it was called “shock treatment.”\\nMany assumed the procedure would be painful, others\\nthought it was a form of electrocution, and still others\\nbelieved it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately,\\nunfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and\\nmovies added to these fears.\\nIndeed, in those early years, patients and families\\nwere rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this\\nor other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no\\nanesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result,\\npatients had violent seizures, and even though they did\\nnot remember them, the procedure itself was frightening.\\nThe way these treatments are given today is very dif-\\nferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently,\\nECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis.\\nHospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen,\\nsuction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in\\norder to deal with the rare emergency.\\nThe treatment is carried out as follows: approxi-\\nmately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time,\\nthe patient may receive an injection of a medication\\n(such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas-\\ning too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient is\\nplaced on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat-\\nically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse,\\nrespiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon-\\nitor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol-\\nlowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes all\\nof the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, and\\nthe risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated.\\nWhen the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air-\\nway is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec-\\ntrodes are placed on the sides of the head in the temple\\nareas. An electric current is passed through the brain by\\nmeans of a machine specifically designed for this pur-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1149\\nElectroconvulsive therapy'),\n",

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic\\nphase), the muscles in the body that have not been para-\\nlyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15\\nseconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic\\nphase) that is characterized by twitching movements,\\nusually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm\\nor leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and\\nrelaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts\\napproximately 10–60 seconds. The entire procedure,\\nfrom beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes.\\nThe total number of treatments a patient will receive\\ndepends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the\\nhistory of illness, family support, and response to thera-\\npy. Patients with depression, for example, usually require\\nsix to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered\\nevery other day, three times a week.\\nThe electrodes may be placed on both sides of the\\nhead (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral\\nECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral\\nECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro-\\nlonged confusion or forgetfulness following treatment.\\nMany doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then\\nchange to bilateral if the patient is not improving.\\nPost-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com-\\nmon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT.\\nDoctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by\\nproviding patients with factual information about recov-\\nery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas-\\ningly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue.\\nThese symptoms usually subside with time, but a small\\nminority of patients state that they have never fully\\nrecovered from these effects.\\nWith the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the\\nuse of ECT became less frequent. These new medications\\nprovided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered\\ngreatly from their illness. However, there are a number of\\nside effects associated with these drugs, some of which are\\nirreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do\\nnot produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During\\nthis time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth-\\ners. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to\\nmedicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these\\nindividuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help.\\nPreparation\\nPatients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being\\nshown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the\\nrisks involved. The physician then answers any questions\\nthese individuals may have, and the patient is asked to\\nsign an “Informed Consent Form.” This gives the doctor\\nand the hospital permission to administer the treatment.\\nOnce the form is signed, the doctor performs a com-\\nplete physical examination , and orders a number of\\ntests that can help identify any potential problem. These\\ntests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram\\n(ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and\\ncomplete blood count (CBC).\\nSome medications, such as lithium and a type of anti-\\ndepressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors ,\\nshould be discontinued for some time before treatment.\\nPatients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight\\nhours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi-\\nbility of vomiting and choking.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery\\narea. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the\\npatient is fully awake, which may take 15–30 minutes.\\nSome initial confusion may be present but usually disap-\\npears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of\\nheadache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is\\nquickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin.\\nRisks\\nAdvanced medical technology has substantially\\nreduced the complications associated with ECT. These\\ninclude slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat\\n(tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion.

It is also used\\nto assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g.,\\nstroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep\\ndisorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s dis-\\nease and Parkinson’s disease , and certain mental disor-\\nders (e.g.,alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism).\\nAn EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity\\nduring surgery and to determine brain death.\\nPrecautions\\nElectroencephalography should be administered and\\ninterpreted by a trained medical professional only. Data\\nfrom an EEG is only one element of a complete medical\\nand/or psychological patient assessment, and should\\nnever be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.\\nDescription\\nBefore the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach-\\nes approximately 16–20 electrodes to the patient’s scalp\\nwith a conductive, washable paste. Depending on the\\npurpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodes\\nare occasionally used. Implantable electrodes include\\nsphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires inserted\\nunder the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec-\\ntrodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain.\\nThe EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea-\\nsure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain.\\nFor the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table,\\nor comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain still\\nduring the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes no\\nmore than one hour. During the test procedure, the\\npatient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visual\\nstimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board may\\nbe used to stimulate certain types of brain activity.\\nThroughout the procedure, the electroencephalograph\\nmachine makes a continuous graphic record of the\\npatient’s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip of\\nrecording paper or on a computer screen. This graphic\\nrecord is called an electroencephalogram.\\nThe sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce-\\ndures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG\\nare encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than just\\nrelax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet room\\nconducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours.\\nIn an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a\\nportable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor-\\nmal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for a\\nperiod of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patient\\nand patient’s family record any symptoms or abnormal\\nbehaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG to\\nsee if they represent seizures.\\nMany insurance plans provide reimbursement for\\nEEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to more\\nthan $500, depending on the purpose and type of test\\n(i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec-\\ntrodes).

These mole-\\ncules, which are either positive (cations) or negative\\n(anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance\\npH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also\\nfacilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells\\nthrough a process known as osmosis and play a part in\\nregulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine,\\nand excretory systems.\\nThe serum electrolytes include:\\n• Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that\\nhelps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates\\nneuromuscular functioning.\\n• Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this\\npositive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular\\nfunction and osmotic pressure.\\n• Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that\\naffects neuromuscular performance and contributes to\\nskeletal growth and blood coagulation.\\n• Magnesium (Mg).

Electrolytes with a positive charge\\ninclude sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; the\\nnegative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate.\\nThe concentrations of these ions in the bloodstream\\nremain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthy\\nperson. Changes in the concentration of one or more of\\nthese ions can occur during various acute and chronic\\ndisease states and can lead to serious consequences.\\nPurpose\\nTests that measure the concentration of electrolytes\\nare useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for\\nthe diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests are\\nused for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss of\\nnutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea ,o r\\nabnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte within\\nthe body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect-\\ned, the physician may either act to immediately correct\\nthe imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) or\\nrun further tests to determine the underlying cause of the\\nabnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances can\\noccur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure),\\ninfections that produce severe and continual diarrhea or\\nvomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in the\\nurine (diuretics), poisoning due to accidental consump-\\ntion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones that\\nregulate electrolyte concentrations.\\nPrecautions\\nElectrolyte tests are performed from routine blood\\ntests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairly\\nuniform throughout the United States. During the prepa-\\nration of blood plasma or serum, health workers must\\ntake care not to break the red blood cells, especially\\nwhen testing for serum potassium. Because the concen-\\ntration of potassium within red blood cells is much high-\\ner than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cells\\nwould cause falsely elevated potassium levels.\\nDescription\\nElectrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood\\nplasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytes\\ncan be classified in at least five different ways. One way\\nis that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells,\\nor are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells,\\nor are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne-\\nsium occur at much greater levels inside the cell than\\noutside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greater\\nlevels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish-\\nes those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans-\\nmission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium,\\npotassium, and calcium are the important electrolytes\\ninvolved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting them\\nare most closely associated with neurological disorders.\\nA third classification focuses on electrolytes that are able\\nto form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal-\\ncium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to form\\ncomplexes with each other. Disorders that cause an\\nincrease in either plasma calcium or phosphate can result\\nin the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft\\ntissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns those\\nelectrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the\\nbloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood-\\nstream is normally in the range of 7.35–7.45. A decrease\\nbelow this range is called acidosis, while a pH above this\\nrange is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closely\\nassociated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon-\\nate, chloride, and phosphate.\\nPreparation\\nAll electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or\\nserum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam-\\nple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that\\nprevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is\\nprepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in a\\ntest tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneously\\nclots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from a\\nvein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with a\\ncentrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot.\\nNormal results\\nElectrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea-\\nsured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed in\\nterms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) or\\nin the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity\\n(moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor-\\nmal values sometimes varies slightly between different\\nage groups, for males and females, and between different\\nanalytical laboratories.\\nThe normal level of serum sodium is in the range of\\n136–145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are\\n3.5–5.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higher\\nconcentration than potassium.

The normal level of\\nphosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phospho-\\nrus, is 2.0–4.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte that\\nis freely and spontaneously interconvertable with carbon-\\nic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration of\\ncarbonic acid (H2CO3) is about 1.35 mM. The normal\\nconcentration of bicarbonate (HCO 3\\n/H11002\\n) is about 27 mM.\\nThe concentration of total carbon dioxide is the sum of\\ncarbonic acid and bicarbonate; this sum is normally in\\nthe range of 26–28 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbon-\\nic acid is more significant than the actual concentrations\\nof these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value is\\n27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1).\\nAbnormal results\\nPositively charged electrolytes\\nHigh serum sodium levels (hypernatremia) occur at\\nsodium concentrations over 145 mM, with severe hyper-\\nnatremia over 152 mM. Hypernatremia is usually caused\\nby diseases that cause excessive urination. In these cases,\\nwater is lost, but sodium is still retained in the body. The\\nsymptoms include confusion and can lead to convulsions\\nand coma. Low serum sodium levels (hyponatremia) are\\nbelow 130 mM, with severe hyponatremia at or below 125\\nmM. Hyponatremia often occurs with severe diarrhea,\\nwith losses of both water and sodium, but with sodium\\nloss exceeding water loss. Hyponatremia provokes clinical\\nproblems only if serum sodium falls below 125 mM, espe-\\ncially if this has occurred rapidly. The symptoms can be as\\nmild as tiredness but may lead to convulsions and coma.\\nHigh serum potassium ( hyperkalemia) occurs at\\npotassium levels above 5.0 mM; it is considered severe\\nover 8.0 mM. Hyperkalemia is relatively uncommon, but\\nsometimes occurs in patients with kidney failure who take\\npotassium supplements. Hyperkalemia can result in abnor-\\nmal beating of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias). Low\\nserum potassium ( hypokalemia) occurs when serum\\npotassium falls below 3.0 mM. It can result from low\\ndietary potassium, as during starvation or in patients with\\nanorexia nervosa; from excessive losses via the kidneys,\\nas caused by diuretic drugs; or by diseases of the adrenal\\nor pituitary glands. Mild hypokalemia causes muscle\\nweakness, while severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis,\\nthe inability to breathe, and cardiac arrhythmias.\\nHigh levels of calcium ions ( hypercalcemia) occur\\nat free calcium ion concentrations over 5.2 mg/dL or\\ntotal serum calcium above 10.4 mg/dL. Hypercalcemia\\nusually occurs when the body dissolves bone at an abnor-\\nmally fast rate, increasing both serum calcium and serum\\nphosphate. Sudden hypercalcemia can cause vomiting\\nand coma, while prolonged and moderate hypercalcemia\\nresults in the deposit of calcium phosphate crystals in the\\nkidneys and eye. Hypocalcemia occurs when serum free\\ncalcium ions fall below 4.4 mg/dL, or when total serum\\ncalcium falls below 8.8 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can result\\nfrom hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone),\\nfrom failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, from\\nlow levels of plasma magnesium, and from phosphate\\npoisoning (the phosphate enters the bloodstream and\\nforms a complex with the free serum calcium). Hypocal-\\ncemia can cause depression and muscle spasms.\\nHypermagnesemia occurs at serum magnesium lev-\\nels over 25 mM (60 mg/dL). Hypermagnesemia is rare\\nbut can occur with the excessive consumption of magne-\\nsium salts. Hypomagnesemia occurs when serum magne-\\nsium levels fall below 0.8 mM, and can result from poor\\nnutrition. Chronic alcoholism is the most common\\ncause of hypomagnesemia, in part because of poor diet.\\nMagnesium levels below 0.5 mM (1.2 mg/dL) cause\\nserum calcium levels to decline. Some of the symptoms\\nof hypomagnesemia, including twitching and convul-\\nsions, actually result from the concurrent hypocalcemia.\\nHypomagnesemia can also result in hypokalemia and\\nthereby cause cardiac arrhythmias.\\nNegatively charged electrolytes\\nSerum chloride levels sometimes increase to abnor-\\nmal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical treat-\\nment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. The\\ntoxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, but\\nfrom the fact that the chloride occurs as the acid, hydro-\\ngen chloride (more commonly known as hydrochloric\\nacid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride may cause the\\naccumulation of hydrochloric acid in the bloodstream,\\nwith consequent acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis, one of\\nmany kidney diseases, involves the failure to release acid\\ninto the urine. The acidosis produces weakness,\\nheadache, nausea, and cardiac arrest. Low plasma chlo-\\nride leads to the opposite situation: a decline in the acid\\ncontent of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalization\\nof the bloodstream, or alkalosis.

Tests for heart func-\\ntion (an electrocardiogram) and parathyroid hormone lev-\\nels are used in the diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia.\\nHypophosphatemia occurs if serum phosphorus falls to\\n2.0 mg/dL or lower. It often results from a shift of inorgan-\\nic phosphate from the bloodstream to various organs and\\ntissues. This shift can be caused by a rise in pH (alkaliza-\\ntion) of the bloodstream, which can occur during hyper-\\nventilation, a reaction in various disease states. A shift in\\nphosphate to intracellular tissues may draw calcium away\\nfrom the bloodstream via the formation of insoluble calci-\\num phosphate crystals within cells, with consequent\\nhypocalcemia. Thus, tests for abnormalities in phosphate\\nmetabolism also involve tests for serum calcium.\\nBicarbonate metabolism involves several com-\\npounds. When dietary starches, sugars, and fats are bro-\\nken down for energy production, carbon dioxide is creat-\\ned. Much of this carbon dioxide (CO2) spontaneously\\nconverts to carbonic acid (H 2CO3), and some of the car-\\nbonic acid spontaneously converts to bicarbonate\\n(HCO3\\n/H11002\\n) plus a hydrogen ion (H\\n+\\n). Eventually, almost\\nevery molecule of carbon dioxide produced in the body,\\nwhether in the form of carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, or\\nbicarbonate, must convert back to carbon dioxide in\\norder to leave via the lungs during normal breathing.\\nIf one holds one’s breath, carbon dioxide cannot\\nescape from the lungs, but continues to be generated with-\\nin the body. This results in an increase in production of\\ncarbonic acid. A portion of the carbonic acid breaks apart\\n(dissociates), causing an increase in hydrogen ions in the\\nplasma, with a resulting acidosis. Tests for serum bicar-\\nbonate levels are accompanied by tests for acidosis (pH\\ntest). Conversely, when one breathes too rapidly (hyper-\\nventilation), the carbon dioxide is drawn off from the\\nbloodstream and expelled in the breath at an increased\\nrate. This results in an increase in the rate of combination\\nof bicarbonate with hydrogen ions, resulting in alkalosis.\\nAcidosis and alkalosis can be produced by means other\\nthan by altering the rate of breathing. The carbonic acid\\nand bicarbonate in the bloodstream minimize (or buffer)\\nany trend to acidosis or alkalosis. Tests for bicarbonate\\nare generally accompanied by tests for blood pH and pos-\\nsibly tests for kidney malfunction, abnormal hormone\\nfunction, or gastrointestinal disorders.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

Electronic fetal moni-\\ntoring is performed late in pregnancyor continuously dur-\\ning labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM\\ncan be utilized either externally or internally in the womb.\\nPurpose\\nThe heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust-\\nment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli.\\nThe fetal monitor records an unborn baby’s heart rate and\\ngraphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoring\\nis usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when the\\nbaby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFM\\ninclude: babies in a breech position,premature labor ,\\nand induced labor, among others.\\nWhen electronic fetal monitoring was originally\\nintroduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that it\\nwould help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack of\\noxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lack\\nof oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birth\\nasphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn\\ndeaths. It occurs when there are less than normal\\namounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ and\\nthere is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue.\\nA lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia.\\nPerinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth,\\nshortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If the\\ninterruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the baby\\nmay recover without any damage. If the time is longer,\\nthere may be some injury that is reversible. If the time\\nperiod without oxygen is very long, there may be perma-\\nnent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor-\\ntant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible.\\nOne of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm in\\nthe unborn baby, which can be detected by electronic\\nfetal monitoring.\\nThe fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the\\nmachine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby’s\\nheartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits just\\npicks up the sound of the baby’s heart beating. The fetal\\nmonitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heart\\nrate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con-\\ntractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps the\\ndoctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling the\\nstressof contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby’s\\nheartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then go\\nback to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks for\\nany changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there is\\na drastic drop in the baby’s heart beat or if the heart rate\\ndoes not recover immediately after a contraction.\\nBecause it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When\\nan adult complains to a provider about not feeling well,\\nchecking the heart rate is only one of many things that\\nthe doctor will do.

In\\nthis test, changes in the baby’s heart rate are measured\\nalong with the fetus’ own movements. The heart rate of a\\nhealthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves.\\nFetal monitoring is used on and off during early\\nlabor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is often\\nneeded. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni-\\ntor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends to\\nbe the most stressful time for the baby.\\nA baby who is having trouble in labor will show char-\\nacteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (late\\ndecelerations).

The provider can place it on\\nthe baby’s head during an internal exam. The internal\\nmonitor can only be used when the cervix is already\\nopen. This device provides a more accurate record of the\\nbaby’s heart rate.\\nPreparation\\nThere are no special preparations needed for fetal\\nmonitoring.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBreech presentation —Fetal position in which the\\nbuttocks come first.\\nA cesarean section—delivery of a baby through an\\nincision in the mother’s abdomen instead of\\nthrough the vagina.\\nHypoxia—An oxygen deficiency.\\nRisks\\nExternal EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How-\\never, because of being connected to the machine, the\\nmother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolong\\nlabor and reduce oxygen levels in the mother’s blood, both\\nof which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Another\\nproblem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to be\\nassociated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. There\\nis a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress in\\nthe baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians.\\nWith internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec-\\ntion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre-\\nventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi-\\ndence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-risk\\nwomen in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians,\\nhowever, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it to\\nbe of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors.\\nNormal results\\nAn unborn baby’s heart rate normally ranges from\\n120–160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv-\\ning enough oxygen through the placenta will move\\naround. The monitor strip will show the baby’s heart rate\\nrising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult’s heart\\nrate rises when he/she moves).\\nThe baby’s monitor strip is considered to be reactive\\nwhen the baby’s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above the\\nbaseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This must\\noccur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactive\\nheart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stress\\ntest) is considered a sign of the baby’s well being.\\nAbnormal results\\nIf the baby’s heart rate drops very low or rises very\\nhigh, this signals a serious problem. In either of these\\ncases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must be\\ndelivered soon. However, many babies who are having\\nproblems do not give such clear signs.\\nDuring a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the\\nmother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarily\\nstopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath during\\neach contraction. Both the placenta and the baby are\\ndesigned to withstand this condition. Between contrac-\\ntions, the baby should be receiving more than enough\\noxygen to do well during the contraction.\\nThe first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy-\\ngen between contractions is often a drop in the baby’s\\nheart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). The\\nbaby’s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con-\\ntractions, only to drop again after the next contraction.\\nThis is also a more subtle sign of distress.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1162\\nElectronic fetal monitoring'),\n",

Swartout-Corbeil, R.N.\\nElectrophysiology study of \\nthe heart\\nDefinition\\nAn electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a\\nnonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system\\n(normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car-\\ndiac catheters and sophisticated computers to generate\\nelectrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea-\\nsurements with exquisite precision from within the heart\\nchambers.\\nThe EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic\\npurposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca-\\ntion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunction\\nwith a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation.\\nThe test is simple, not painful, and performed in a\\nspecial laboratory under controlled clinical circum-\\nstances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize in\\nelectrophysiology.\\nPurpose\\nA cardiologist may recommend an EP study when\\nthe standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress\\ntest, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide\\nenough information to evaluate an abnormal heart\\nrhythm, called an arrhythmia.\\nAn EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a\\nsuspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms\\nof an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected\\nfrom other tests.\\nThe purpose and great value of an EP study is that it\\noffers more detailed information to the doctor about the\\nelectrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned\\nnoninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly\\nonheart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to\\ndetermine the specific location of an arrhythmia and,\\noftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This\\ncorrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure,\\nand, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heart\\nmedications.\\nEP studies may be helpful in assessing:\\n• certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown\\ncause.\\n• patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing\\nsudden cardiac death.\\n• various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest\\npain, shortness of breath , fatigue, or syncope (dizzi-\\nness/fainting).\\n• response to anti-arrhythmic therapy.\\nPrecautions\\nPregnant patients should not undergo an EP study\\nbecause of exposure to radiation during the study, which\\nmay be harmful to the growing baby.\\nPatients who have coronary artery disease may\\nneed to have that treated before having an EP study.\\nDescription\\nThe rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is\\nessentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses\\ntraveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham-\\nbers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA)\\nnode, which are specialized cells situated in the top right\\nchamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA\\nnode, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates\\nthe impulses, which travel through specific pathways\\nthroughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node.\\nThe A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses to\\nmore specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom\\nchambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways\\nbecome damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path-\\nways exist, the heart’s rhythm may be altered (perhaps\\ntoo slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously\\naffect the heart’s pumping ability.\\nThe patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP\\nlab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are\\nplaced over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are\\ninserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin\\narea. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number\\nof catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart\\nmay vary.

The\\ncatheters used in catheter ablation are slightly larger.\\nWith the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television\\nscreen), all the catheters are guided to several specific\\nlocations in the heart. Typically, four to 10 electrodes are\\nlocated on the end of the catheters, which have the ability\\nto send electrical signals to stimulate the heart (called\\npacing) and to receive electrical signals from the heart—\\nbut not at the same time (just as a walkie-talkie cannot\\nsend and receive messages at the same time).\\nFirst, the electrodes are positioned to receive signals\\nfrom inside the heart chambers.

The\\nlong, threadlike worms block the body’s lymphatic sys-\\ntem—a network of channels, lymph nodes, and organs\\nthat helps maintain proper fluid levels in the body by\\ndraining lymph from tissues into the bloodstream. This\\nblockage causes fluids to collect in the tissues, which can\\nlead to great swelling, called “lymphedema.” Limbs can\\nswell so enormously that they resemble an elephant’s\\nforeleg in size, texture, and color. This is the severely dis-\\nfiguring and disabling condition of elephantiasis.\\nThere are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but\\nthe agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in the\\nworld are filarial worms: white, slender round worms\\nfound in most tropical and subtropical places. They are\\ntransmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes,\\nthat is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these worms\\nis called “lymphatic filariasis” and over a long period of\\ntime can cause elephantiasis.\\nLymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped\\nregions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, the\\nPacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is a disease that has\\nbeen present for centuries, as ancient Persian and Indian\\nwritings clearly described elephant-like swellings of the\\narms, legs, and genitals. It is estimated that 120 million\\npeople in the world have lymphatic filariasis, as of 1997.\\nThe disease appears to be spreading, in spite of decades\\nof research in this area.\\nOther terms for elephantiasis are Barbados leg, ele-\\nphant leg, morbus herculeus, mal de Cayenne, and\\nmyelolymphangioma.\\nOther situations that can lead to elephantiasis are:\\n• a protozoan disease called leishmaniasis\\n• a repeated streptococcal infection\\n• the surgical removal of lymph nodes (usually to prevent\\nthe spread of cancer)\\n• a hereditary birth defect\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThree kinds of round worms cause elephantiasis filar-\\niasis: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi , and Brugia\\ntimori. Of these three,W. bancroftimakes up about 90% of\\nthe cases. Man is the only known host of W. bancrofti.\\nCulex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes are the car-\\nriers of W. bancrofti. Anopheles and Mansonia mosqui-\\ntoes are the carriers of B. malayi. In addition, Anopheles\\nmosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori.\\nInfected female mosquitoes take a blood meal from\\na human, and, in doing so, introduce larval forms of the\\nparticular parasite they carry to the person. These larvae\\nmigrate toward a lymphatic channel, then travel to vari-\\nous places within the lymphatic system, usually position-\\ning themselves in or near lymph nodes throughout the\\nbody. During this time, they mature into more developed\\nlarvae and eventually into adult worms. Depending upon\\nthe species of round worm, this development can take a\\nfew months or more than a year. The adult worms grow\\nto about 1 in (2.5 cm) to 4 in (10 cm) long.\\nThe adult worms can live from about three to eight\\nyears. Some have been known to live to 20 years, and in\\none case 40 years. The adult worms begin reproducing\\nnumerous live embryos, called microfilariae. The micro-\\nfilariae travel to the bloodstream, where they can be\\ningested by a mosquito when it takes a blood meal from\\nthe infected person. If they are not ingested by a mosqui-\\nto, the microfilariae die within about 12 months. If they\\nare ingested by a mosquito, they continue to mature.\\nThey are totally dependent on their specific species of\\nmosquito to develop further. The cycle continues when\\nthe mosquito takes another blood meal.\\nMost of the symptoms an infected person experi-\\nences are due to the blockage of the lymphatic system by\\nthe adult worms and due to the substances (excretions\\nand secretions) produced by the worms.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1166\\nElephantiasis'),\n",

Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of\\nthe affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired-\\nness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur.\\nAbscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphatic\\nvessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well.\\nLong-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can\\nlead to lymphedema, hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any\\nsaclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis of\\nthe legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. The\\nmost common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typically\\nbegins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. At\\nfirst the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu-\\nally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark-\\nened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria to\\ninfect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari-\\nae usually don’t cause injury. In some instances, they\\ncause “eosinophilia,” an increased number of eosinophils\\n(a type of white blood cells) in the blood.\\nThis disease is more intense in people who never\\nhave been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in the\\nnative people of tropical areas where the disease occurs.\\nThis is because many of the native people often are\\nimmunologically tolerant.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is\\nby detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or\\nthe microfilariae.\\nMicroscopic examination of the person’s blood may\\nreveal microfilariae.

The absence of them, therefore, does\\nnot mean necessarily that the person is not infected. In\\nthese cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid or\\nperforming other clinical tests is necessary.\\nCollecting blood from the individual for microscopic\\nexamination should be done during the night when the\\nmicrofilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream.\\n(Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent-\\nly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper blood\\nvessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decided\\nto perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi-\\nvidual may be given a “provocative” dose of medication\\nto provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream.\\nBlood then can be collected an hour later for examination.\\nDetecting the adult worms can be difficult because\\nthey are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult to\\nget to. Biopsies usually are not performed because they\\nusually don’t reveal much information.\\nTreatment\\nThe drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is\\ndiethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the United\\nStates is Hetrazan.\\nThe treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day,\\nthree times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken in\\ntablet form.\\nDEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or\\nkills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adult\\nworms are not killed, remaining paired males and\\nfemales may continue to produce more larvae. There-\\nfore, several courses of DEC treatment over a long\\ntime period may be necessary to rid the individual of\\nthe parasites.\\nDEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged\\nlymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele-\\nphantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of a\\nmedicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1167\\nElephantiasis\\nMan suffering from elephantiasis.

The plural of\\nembolism is emboli.\\nDescription\\nEmboli have moved from the place where they were\\nformed through the bloodstream to another part of the\\nbody, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow of\\nblood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clots\\nbut are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis-\\nsue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single\\nand massive. They can be life-threatening and require\\nimmediate emergency medical care. There are three gen-\\neral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary.\\nPulmonary emboli are the most common.\\nArterial embolism\\nIn arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc-\\ntion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, or\\nthigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication of\\nheart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere-\\nbral embolism) causes stroke, which can be fatal. An\\nestimated 5–14% of all strokes are caused by cerebral\\nemboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis-\\nsue death and amputation of the affected limb if not\\ntreated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys\\ncan also suffer damage from emboli.\\nGas embolism\\nGas emboli result from the compression of respira-\\ntory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapid\\nchanges in environmental pressure, for example, while\\nflying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases,\\ngases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood and\\nother tissues become small bubbles that can block blood\\nflow and cause organ damage.\\nPulmonary embolism\\nIn a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood\\nflow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block\\nthe main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are\\nno initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quickly\\nbecome fatal. According to the American Heart Associa-\\ntion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonary\\nemboli annually and 60,000 die from it.\\nA pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less\\nthan 10% of patients who die from a pulmonary\\nembolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than\\n90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications of\\ndeep vein thrombosis, blood clots in the deep vein of\\nthe leg or pelvis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nArterial emboli are usually a complication of heart\\ndisease where blood clots form in the heart’s chambers.\\nGas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen-\\ntal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div-\\ning. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that\\ntravel through the blood stream to the lungs and block a\\npulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul-\\nmonary embolism are a complication of deep vein\\nthrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who have\\nhad orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or\\nother chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure.\\nRisk factors for arterial and pulmonary emboli\\ninclude: prolonged bed rest, surgery, childbirth , heart\\nattack, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer,obesity,a\\nbroken hip or leg, oral contraceptives , sickle cell ane-\\nmia, chest trauma, certain congenital heart defects, and\\nold age. Risk factors for gas emboli include: scuba div-\\ning, amateur plane flight,exercise, injury, obesity, dehy-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1169\\nEmbolism'),\n",

For arterial\\nemboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are\\nordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung\\nscan, pulmonary angiography , electrocardiography ,\\narterial blood gas measurements, and venography or\\nvenous ultrasound could be ordered.\\nDiagnosing an arterial embolism\\nUltrasound uses sound waves to create an image of\\nthe heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel\\nto a hand-held transducer then presses it against the\\npatient’s body. The ultrasound’s sound waves arteries are\\nconverted into an image that can be displayed on a moni-\\ntor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the\\ntest takes 30–60 minutes.\\nAn arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi-\\num is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It\\ncan be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or\\ndiagnostic center of a hospital.\\nDiagnosing a pulmonary embolism\\nA chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect\\nother respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows\\npoor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The\\npatient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical\\nand pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a\\ngamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is\\ninjected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned.\\nA normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary\\nembolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or\\nan outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes.\\nPulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for\\ndiagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often\\nbecause it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available\\nin most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic\\ntest which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to\\nshow the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records\\nthe blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul-\\nmonary angiography is usually performed in a hospital’s\\nradiology medicine department and takes 30–60 minutes.\\nAn electrocardiograph shows the heart’s electrical\\nactivity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism\\nfrom a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting\\njelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.\\nImpulses of the heart’s activity are traced on paper. The\\ntest takes about 10 minutes.\\nArterial blood gas measurements are sometimes\\nhelpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary\\nembolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a\\nvein, usually in the wrist.\\nVenography is used to look for the most likely\\nsource of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.\\nIt is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is\\npainful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high\\ndose of radiation, and can cause complications.

In this\\nprocedure, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the\\nartery to remove thromboembolic matter.\\nWith a pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy is\\noften used to maintain normal oxygen concentrations.\\nFor people who can’t take anticoagulants and in some\\nother cases, surgery may be needed to insert a device that\\nfilters blood returning to the heart and lungs.\\nPrognosis\\nOf patients hospitalized with an arterial embolism,\\n25–30% die, and 5–25% require amputation of a limb.\\nAbout 10% of patients with a pulmonary embolism die\\nsuddenly within the first hour of onset of the condition.\\nThe outcome for all other patients is generally good; only\\n3% of patients die who are properly diagnosed early and\\ntreated.

There are\\n1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif-\\nteenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations of\\nactivity. The disease is usually caused by smoking, but a\\nsmall number of cases are caused by an inherited defect.\\nNormally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently\\nexpanding and recoiling as air passes freely through the\\nbronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into the\\nblood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a person\\ninhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his or\\nher immune system responds by releasing substances\\nthat are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke.\\nThese substances can also attack the cells of the lungs,\\nbut the body normally inhibits such action with the\\nrelease of other substances. In smokers and those with\\nthe inherited defect, however, no such prevention occurs\\nand the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it loses\\nits elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead-\\ning to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli.\\nThe alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the air\\nout, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses,\\ncoughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later\\nstages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the\\nblood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratory\\ndiseases, particularly chronic bronchitis. These two dis-\\neases are often referred to as one disorder called chronic\\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\\nEmphysema is most common among people aged 50\\nand older. Those with inherited emphysema may experience\\nthe onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are more\\nlikely than women to develop emphysema, but female cases\\nare increasing as the number of female smokers rises.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHeavy cigarette smoking causes about 80–90% of\\nall emphysema cases. However a few cases are the result\\nof an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1-\\nantitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with this\\ndeficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than\\n70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can also\\ndamage the lungs. While a person may be less likely to\\ninhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke can\\nalso impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be even\\nmore damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held in\\nby the smoker.\\nThe symptoms of emphysema develop gradually\\nover many years. It is a common occurrence for many\\nemphysema patients to have lost over half of their func-\\ntioning lung tissue before they become aware that some-\\nthing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough\\n(which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thick\\nsputum, and often dismissed as “smoker’s cough”), and\\nsometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1172\\nEmphysema'),\n",

Those with emphyse-\\nma are at risk for a variety of other complications result-\\ning from weakened lung function, including pneumonia.\\nDiagnosis\\nA variety of pulmonary function tests may be\\nordered. In the early stages of emphysema, the only\\nresult may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patients\\nwith emphysema may show an increase in the total\\namount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), but\\na decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed out\\nafter taking a deep breath (vital capacity). With severe\\nemphysema, vital capacity is substantially below normal.\\nSpirometry, a procedure that measures air flow and lung\\nvolume, helps in the diagnosis of emphysema.\\nA chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis\\nof emphysema, though patients in the early stages of the\\ndisease may have normal findings. Abnormal findings on\\nthe chest x ray include over-inflation of the lungs and an\\nabnormally increased chest diameter. The diaphragm may\\nappear depressed or flattened. In addition, patients with\\nadvanced emphysema may show a smaller or vertical\\nheart. The physician may observe blisters in the lungs and\\nbulging of the accessory muscles of the respiratory sys-\\ntem. Late in the disease, an EKG will show signs of right\\nventricular failure in the heart and increased hemoglobin\\ndue to lower levels of oxygen in the patient’s blood.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment methods for emphysema do not cure or\\nreverse the damage to the lungs. However, they may slow\\nthe progression of the disease, relieve symptoms, and\\nhelp control possibly fatal complications. The first step\\nin treatment for smokers is to quit, so as to prevent any\\nfurther deterioration of breathing ability. Smoking cessa-\\ntion programs may be effective. Consistent encourage-\\nment along with the help of health care professionals as\\nwell as family and friends can help increase the success\\nrate of someone attempting to quit.\\nIf the patient and the health care team develop and\\nmaintain a complete program of respiratory care, disabil-\\nity can be decreased, acute episodes of illness may be\\nprevented, and the number of hospitalizations reduced.\\nHowever, only quitting smoking has been shown to slow\\ndown the progression of the disease, and among all other\\ntreatments, only oxygen therapy has shown an increase\\nin the survival rate.\\nHome oxygen therapy may improve the survival\\ntimes in those patients with advanced emphysema who\\nalso have low blood oxygen levels. It may improve the\\npatient’s tolerance of exercise, as well as improve their\\nperformance in certain aspects of brain function and\\nmuscle coordination. The functioning of the heart may\\nalso improve with an increased concentration of oxygen\\nin the blood. Oxygen may also decrease insomnia and\\nheadaches. Some patients may only receive oxygen at\\nnight, but studies have illustrated that it is most effective\\nwhen administered at least 18, but preferably 24 hours\\nper day. Portable oxygen tanks prescribed to patients\\ncarry a limited supply and must be refilled on a regular\\nbasis by a home health provider. Medicare and most\\ninsurance companies cover a large proportion of the cost\\nof home oxygen therapy. Patients should be instructed\\nregarding special safety issues involving the transport\\nand presence of oxygen in the home.\\nA variety of medications may be used in the treat-\\nment of emphysema. Usually the patient responds best to\\na combination of medicines, rather than one single drug.\\nBronchodilators are sometimes used to help alle-\\nviate the patient’s symptoms by relaxing and opening\\nthe airways.

The name comes\\nfrom the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing\\n(suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col-\\nlections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav-\\nity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in the\\ngall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleural\\ncavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye-\\nma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else-\\nwhere in the body.\\nDescription\\nEmpyema may have a number of causes but is most\\nfrequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop-\\nment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase in\\nwhich the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containing\\nsome pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens and\\na fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu-\\nlate within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage in\\nwhich the lung or other organ is encased within a thick\\ncovering of fibrous material.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEmpyema thoracis can be caused by a number of dif-\\nferent organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and amebas, in\\nconnection with pneumonia, chest wounds, chest surgery,\\nlung abscesses, or a ruptured esophagus. The infective\\norganism can get into the pleural cavity either through the\\nbloodstream or other circulatory system, in secretions\\nfrom lung tissue, or on the surfaces of surgical instruments\\nor objects that cause open chest wounds. The most com-\\nmon organisms that cause empyema are the following bac-\\nteria:Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,\\nand Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureusis the most common\\ncause in all age groups, accounting for 90% of cases of\\nempyema in infants and children. Pelvic empyema in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1175\\nEmpyema'),\n",

Brain inflammation\\ncaused by a bacterial infection is sometimes called\\ncerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord are\\ninvolved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. An\\ninflammation of the brain’s covering, or meninges, is\\ncalled meningitis.\\nDescription\\nEncephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The\\ninflammation is a reaction of the body’s immune system\\nto infection or invasion. During the inflammation, the\\nbrain’s tissues become swollen. The combination of the\\ninfection and the immune reaction to it can cause\\nheadacheand a fever, as well as more severe symptoms\\nin some cases.\\nApproximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are\\nreported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,\\nGA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitis\\ncan be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi-\\ndemic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis is\\nresponsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. The\\nviruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmit\\nthe disease. The most common form of non-epidemic or\\nsporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex\\nvirus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death.\\nMumps is another example of a sporadic cause.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThere are more than a dozen viruses that can cause\\nencephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact or\\nby animal bites.

Secondary encephalitis may occur with measles,\\nchickenpox, mumps,rubella, and EBV . In secondary\\nencephalitis, symptoms usually begin five to 10 days after\\nthe onset of the disease itself and are related to the break-\\ndown of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers.\\nIn rare cases, encephalitis may follow vaccination\\nagainst some of the viral diseases listed above.\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a very rare brain disorder\\ncaused by an infectious particle called a prion, may also\\ncause encephalitis.\\nMosquitoes spread viruses responsible for equine\\nencephalitis (eastern and western types), St. Louis\\nencephalitis, California encephalitis, and Japanese\\nencephalitis . Lyme disease, spread by ticks, can cause\\nencephalitis, as can Colorado tick fever. Rabies is most\\noften spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, rac-\\ncoons, squirrels, and bats and may cause encephalitis.\\nEquine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do\\nnot normally bite humans but do bite horses and birds. It\\nis occasionally picked up from these animals by mosqui-\\ntoes that do bite humans. Japanese encephalitis and St.\\nLouis encephalitis are also carried by mosquitoes. The\\nrisk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is greatest in\\nmid- to late summer, when mosquitoes are most active,\\nin those rural areas where these viruses are known to\\nexist. Eastern equine encephalitis occurs in eastern and\\nsoutheastern United States; western equine and Califor-\\nnia encephalitis occur throughout the West; and St. Louis\\nencephalitis occurs throughout the country. Japanese\\nencephalitis does not occur in the United States, but is\\nfound throughout much of Asia. The viruses responsible\\nfor these diseases are classified as arbovirus and these\\ndiseases are collectively called arbovirus encephalitis.\\nHerpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form\\nof sporadic encephalitis in western countries, is a disease\\nwith significantly high mortality. It occurs in children and\\nadults and both sides of the brain are affected. It is theo-\\nrized that brain infection is caused by the virus moving\\nfrom a peripheral location to the brain via two nerves, the\\nolfactory and the trigeminal (largest nerves in the skull).\\nHerpes simplex encephalitis is responsible for 10%\\nof all encephalitis cases and is the main cause of spo-\\nradic, fatal encephalitis. In untreated patients, the rate of\\ndeath is 70% while the mortality is 15–20% in patients\\nwho have been treated with acyclovir. The symptoms of\\nherpes simplex encephalitis are fever, rapidly disintegrat-\\ning mental state, headache, and behavioral changes.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of encephalitis range from very mild\\nto very severe and may include:\\n• headache\\n•f e v e r\\n• lethargy (sleepiness, decreased alertness, and fatigue)\\n• malaise\\n• nausea and vomiting\\n• visual disturbances\\n• tremor\\n• decreased consciousness (drowsiness, confusion,delir-\\nium, and unconsciousness)\\n• stiff neck\\n• seizures\\nSymptoms may progress rapidly, changing from\\nmild to severe within several days or even several hours.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question-\\ning to determine possible exposure to viral sources.

An\\nendarterectomy is performed to treat cerebrovascular dis-\\nease in which there is a serious reduction of blood supply\\nto the brain (carotid endarterectomy), or to treat periph-\\neral vascular disease(impaired blood supply to the legs).\\nEndarterectomy is most often performed on one of\\nthe two main arteries in the neck (the carotids) opening\\nthe narrowed arteries leading to the brain. When per-\\nformed by an experienced surgeon, the practice is\\nextremely effective, reducing the risk of stroke by up to\\n70%. Recent studies indicate it is effective in preventing\\nstroke, even among those patients who had no warning\\nsigns except narrowed arteries detected by their doctors\\non a routine exam.\\nPrecautions\\nBefore the surgery, a full medical exam is usually\\ndone to assess any specific health problems, such as dia-\\nbetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke. If\\npossible, reversible health problems, such as cigarette\\nsmokingor being overweight, should be corrected.\\nDescription\\nCarotid artery disease\\nEvery person has four carotid arteries (the internal\\nand external carotids on each side of the neck) through\\nwhich blood from the heart moves into the brain. If one\\nof these arteries becomes blocked by fat and cholesterol,\\nthe patient may have a range of symptoms, including:\\n• weakness in one arm, leg, half of the face, or one entire\\nside of the body\\n• numbness tingling\\n•paralysis of an arm, leg, or face\\n• slurred speech\\n• dizziness\\n• confusion,fainting, or coma\\n• stroke\\nRemoving this fatty buildup, or bypassing a blocked\\nsegment, may restore blood flow to the brain, eliminate\\nor decrease the symptoms, and lessen the risk of a stroke.\\nPeripheral vascular disease\\nWhen the blood vessels in the legs (and sometimes\\nthe arms) become narrowed, this can restrict blood flow\\nand cause pain in the affected area. In severe cases, the\\ntissue may die, requiring amputation.\\nThe narrowing is usually caused by buildup of fatty\\nplaques in the vessels, often as the result of smoking,\\nhigh blood pressure, or poorly-controlled diabetes melli-\\ntus.

By\\ndamaging the valves or the walls of the heart chambers,\\nendocarditis can interfere with the ability of the heart to\\ndo its job.\\nEndocarditis rarely occurs in people with healthy,\\nnormal hearts. Rather, it most commonly occurs when\\nthere is damage to the endocardium. The endocardium\\nmay be affected by a congenital heart defect, such as\\nmitral valve prolapse, in which blood leaks through a\\npoorly functioning mitral valve back into the heart. It\\nmay also be damaged by a prior scarring of the heart\\nmuscle, such as rheumatic fever , or replacement of a\\nheart valve. Any of these conditions can damage the\\nendocardium and make it more susceptible to infection.\\nBacteria can get into the blood stream (a condition\\nknown as bacteremia) in a number of different ways: It\\nmay spread from a localized infection such as a urinary\\ntract infection,pneumonia, or skin infection or get into\\nthe blood stream as a result of certain medical condi-\\ntions, such as severe periodontal disease, colon cancer,\\nor inflammatory bowel disease. It can enter the blood\\nstream during minor procedures, such as periodontal\\nsurgery, tooth extractions, teeth cleaning, tonsil removal,\\nprostate removal, or endoscopic examination. It can also\\nbe introduced through in-dwelling catheters, which are\\nused for intravenous medications, intravenous feeding, or\\ndialysis. In people who use intravenous drugs, the bacte-\\nria can enter the blood stream through unsterilized, cont-\\naminated needles and syringes. (People who are prone to\\nendocarditis generally need to take prescribed antibi-\\notics before certain surgical or dental procedures to help\\nprevent this infection.)\\nIf not discovered and treated, infective endocarditis\\ncan permanently damage the heart muscle, especially the\\nvalves. For the heart to work properly, all four valves\\nmust be functioning well, opening at the right time to let\\nblood flow in the right direction and closing at the right\\ntime to keep the blood from flowing in the wrong direc-\\ntion. If the valve is damaged, this may allow blood to flow\\nbackward—a condition known as regurgitation. As a\\nresult of a poorly functioning valve, the heart muscle has\\nto work harder to pump blood and may become weak-\\nened, leading to heart failure. Heart failure is a chronic\\ncondition in which the heart is unable to pump blood well\\nenough to supply blood adequately to the body.\\nAnother danger associated with endocarditis is that\\nthe vegetation formed by bacteria colonizing on heart\\nvalves may break off, forming emboli. These emboli\\nmay travel through the circulation and become lodged in\\nblood vessels. By blocking the flow of blood, emboli\\ncan starve various tissues of nutrients and oxygen, dam-\\naging them. For instance, an embolus lodged in the\\nblood vessels of the lungs may cause pneumonia-like\\nsymptoms. An embolus may also affect the brain, dam-\\naging nerve tissue, or the kidneys, causing kidney dis-\\nease. Emboli may also weaken the tiny blood vessels\\ncalled capillaries, causing hemorrhages (leaking blood\\nvessels) throughout the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost cases of infective endocarditis occur in people\\nbetween the ages of 15 and 60, with a median age at\\nonset of about 50 years. Men are affected about twice as\\noften as women are. Other factors that put people at\\nincreased risk for endocarditis are congenital heart prob-\\nlems, heart surgery, previous episodes of endocarditis,\\nand intravenous drug use.\\nWhile there is no single specific symptom of endo-\\ncarditis, a number of symptoms may be present. The\\nmost common symptom is a mild fever, which rarely\\ngoes above 102°F (38.9°C). Other symptoms include\\nchills, weakness,cough, trouble breathing, headaches,\\naching joints, and loss of appetite.\\nEmboli may also cause a variety of symptoms,\\ndepending on their location. Emboli throughout the\\nbody may cause Osler’s nodes, small, reddish, painful\\nbumps most commonly found on the inside of fingers\\nand toes.

Listening to the\\npatient’s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may also\\nhear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicate\\nabnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham-\\nbers or valves.\\nDoctors take a sample of the patient’s blood to test it\\nfor bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus-\\ning the infection. They usually also use a test called\\nechocardiography, which uses ultrasound waves to\\nmake images of the heart, to check for abnormalities in\\nthe structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell-\\ntale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta-\\ntion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com-\\nposed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting protein\\ncalled fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the\\nbackward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves.\\nA normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili-\\nty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram can\\nconfirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot be\\ndone or its results are inconclusive, a modified technique\\ncalled transesophageal echocardiography is some-\\ntimes performed. Transesophageal echocardiography\\ninvolves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagus\\nto get a clearer image of the heart.\\nTreatment\\nWhen doctors suspect infective endocarditis, they\\nwill admit the patient to a hospital and begin treating the\\ninfection before they even have the results of the blood\\nculture. Their choice of antibiotics depends on what the\\nmost likely infecting microorganism is. Once the results\\nof the blood culture become available, the doctor can\\nadjust the medications, using specific antibiotics known\\nto be effective against the specific microorganism\\ninvolved.\\nUnfortunately, in recent years, the treatment of\\nendocarditis has become more complicated as a result of\\nantibiotic resistance. Over the past few years, especially\\nas antibiotics have been overprescribed, more and more\\nstrains of bacteria have become increasingly resistant to\\na wider range of antibiotics. For this reason, doctors may\\nneed to try a few different types of antibiotics—or even a\\ncombination of antibiotics—to successfully treat the\\ninfection. Antibiotics are usually given for about one\\nmonth, but may need to be given for an even longer peri-\\nod of time if the infection is resistant to treatment.\\nOnce the fever and the worst of the symptoms have\\ngone away, the patient may be able to continue antibiotic\\ntherapy at home. During this time, the patient should\\nmake regular visits to the health care team for further\\ntesting and physical examination to make sure that the\\nantibiotic therapy is working, that it is not causing\\nadverse side effects, and that there are no complications\\nsuch as emboli or heart failure. The patient should alert\\nthe health-care team to any symptoms that could indicate\\nserious complications: For instance, trouble breathing or\\nswelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail-\\nure. Headache, joint pain, blood in the urine, or stroke\\nsymptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever and\\nchills could indicate that the treatment is not working and\\nthe infection is worsening.

Abnormal bleeding\\nincludes bleeding between menstrual periods, excessive\\nbleeding during a menstrual period, or bleeding after\\nmenopause. Since abnormal uterine bleeding can indi-\\ncate cancer, an endometrial biopsy is done to rule out\\nendometrial cancer or hyperplasia (a potentially pre-\\ncancerous condition).\\nEndometrial biopsies are also done as a screening\\ntest for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women on\\nhormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement\\ntherapy usually requires a woman to take estrogen and\\nprogesterone. An endometrial biopsy is particularly use-\\nful in cases where postmenopausal women take estrogen,\\nbut cannot take progesterone. Estrogen in the system\\nwithout the balancing effect of progesterone has been\\nlinked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\\nAn endometrial biopsy can also be used as part of an\\ninfertility exam to rule out problems with the develop-\\nment of the endometrium. This condition is called luteal\\nphase defect and can cause the endometrium to not sup-\\nport a pregnancy. An endometrial biopsy can also be used\\nto evaluate the problem of repeated early miscarriages.\\nPrecautions\\nIf the endometrial biopsy is being done to investigate\\nwhy a woman is unable to get pregnant, the test must be\\nperformed at a specific time during the menstrual cycle.\\nSince the test evaluates whether the endometrium is\\ndeveloped adequately to support implantation and growth\\nof a fertilized egg, it is critical to perform the test approxi-\\nmately three days before the expected menstrual period.\\nDescription\\nThe test is performed by a doctor who specializes in\\nwomen’s reproductive health (an obstetrician/gynecolo-\\ngist). The test is performed either in the doctor’s office or\\nin a local hospital. The patient may be asked to take pain\\nmedication (like Motrin or Aleve) an hour or so before\\nthe procedure. A local anesthetic may be injected into the\\ncervix in order to decrease pain and discomfort during\\nthe procedure.\\nThe woman will be asked to lie on her back with\\nknees apart and feet in stirrups. The doctor will first con-\\nduct a thorough exam of the pelvic region, including the\\nvulva (the external genitals), vagina, and uterus. A specu-\\nlum (an instrument that is used to hold the walls of the\\nvagina open) will be inserted into the vagina. A small,\\nhollow plastic tube is then passed into the uterine cavity.\\nA small piece of the uterine lining is sucked out with a\\nplunger that is attached to the tube. Once the sample is\\nobtained, the instruments are removed. The sample is\\nsent to the laboratory for microscopic examination.\\nThe patient may experience some pain when the\\ncervix is grasped. The patient may also feel some cramp-\\ning, pressure, and discomfort when the instruments are\\ninserted into the uterus and the tissue sample is collected.\\nPreparation\\nFor the small number of endometrial biopsies that\\nare done as part of infertility testing, a pregnancy test is\\nalso often performed before the procedure. Since the\\nbiopsy is performed late in the menstrual cycle, it is pos-\\nsible that the woman may be pregnant.\\nAftercare\\nThe biopsy may cause a small amount of bleeding\\n(spotting). The woman can resume normal activities right\\naway. If cramping becomes severe, heavy bleeding\\noccurs, or the woman develops a high temperature, the\\ndoctor should be notified immediately.\\nIf the test is being done to determine the cause of\\ninfertility, the onset of the menstrual period following the\\nbiopsy should be reported to the doctor.

Approximate-\\nly 34,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer\\neach year. In 1998, approximately 6,300 women died\\nfrom this cancer. Although endometrial cancer generally\\noccurs in women who have gone through menopause\\nand are 45 years of age or older, 30% of the women with\\nendometrial cancer are younger than 40 years of age. The\\naverage age at diagnosis is 60 years old.\\nThe uterus, or womb, is the hollow female organ that\\nsupports the development of the unborn baby during\\npregnancy. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and an\\ninner lining called the endometrium. The endometrium is\\nvery sensitive to hormones and it changes daily during\\nthe menstrual cycle. The endometrium is designed to\\nprovide an ideal environment for the fertilized egg to\\nimplant and begin to grow. If pregnancy does not occur,\\nthe endometrium is shed causing the menstrual period.\\nMore than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the\\nendometrium. The most common type of uterine cancer\\nis adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli-\\ncation of endometrial cells (atypical adenomatous hyper-\\nplasia) and is made up of mature, specialized cells (well-\\ndifferentiated). Less commonly, endometrial cancer aris-\\nes without a preceding hyperplasia and is made up of\\npoorly differentiated cells. The more common of these\\ntypes are the papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas.\\nPoorly differentiated endometrial cancers are often asso-\\nciated with a less promising prognosis.\\nThe highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the\\nUnited States is in Caucasians, Hawaiians, Japanese, and\\nAfrican Americans. American Indians, Koreans, and\\nVietnamese have the lowest incidence. African American\\nand Hawaiian women are more likely to be diagnosed\\nwith advanced cancer and, therefore, have a higher risk\\nof dying from the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of endometrial cancer is\\nunknown, it is clear that high levels of estrogen, when\\nnot balanced by progesterone, can lead to abnormal\\ngrowth of the endometrium. Factors that increase a\\nwoman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer are:\\n• Age. The risk is considerably higher in women who are\\nover the age of 50 and have gone through menopause.\\n• Obesity. Being overweight is a very strong risk factor\\nfor this cancer. Fatty tissue can change other normal\\nbody chemicals into estrogen, which can promote\\nendometrial cancer.\\n• Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro-\\ngen supplements after menopause have a 12 times high-\\ner risk of getting endometrial cancer if progesterone is\\nnot taken simultaneously.\\n• Diabetes. Diabetics have twice the risk of getting this\\ncancer as nondiabetic women. It is not clear if this risk\\nis due to the fact that many diabetics are also obese and\\nhypertensive. One 1998 study found that women who\\nwere obese and diabetic were three times more likely to\\ndevelop endometrial cancer than women who were\\nobese but nondiabetic. This study also found that\\nnonobese diabetics were not at risk of developing\\nendometrial cancer.\\n• Hypertension . High blood pressure (or hypertension)\\nis also considered a risk factor for uterine cancer.\\n• Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual\\ncycle, there is interaction between the hormones estro-\\ngen and progesterone. Women who do not ovulate regu-\\nlarly are exposed to high estrogen levels for longer peri-\\nods of time. If a woman does not ovulate regularly, this\\ndelicate balance is upset and may increase her chances\\nof getting uterine cancer.\\n• Early first menstruation or late menopause. Having\\nthe first period at a young age (the mean age of\\nmenses is 12.16 years in African American girls and\\n12.88 years in caucasian girls) or going through\\nmenopause at a late age (over age 51) seem to put\\nwomen at a slightly higher risk for developing\\nendometrial cancer.\\n• Tamoxifen. This drug, which is used to treat or prevent\\nbreast cancer, increases a woman’s chance of develop-\\ning endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen users tend to have\\nmore advanced endometrial cancer with an associated\\npoorer survival rate than those who do not take the\\ndrug. In many cases, however, the value of tamoxifen\\nfor treating breast cancer and for preventing the cancer\\nfrom spreading far outweighs the small risk of getting\\nendometrial cancer.\\n• Family history.

The stage of cancer is determined after\\nsurgery. Endometrial cancer is categorized into four stages\\n(I, II, III, and IV) that are subdivided (A, B, and possibly C)\\nbased on the depth or spread of cancerous tissue. Seventy\\npercent of all uterine cancers are stage I, 10–15% are stage\\nII, and the remainder are stages III and IV . The cancer is\\nalso graded (G1, G2, and G3) based upon microscopic\\nanalysis of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells.\\nThe FIGO stages for endometrial cancer are:\\n• Stage I. Cancer is limited to the uterus.\\n• Stage II. Cancer involves the uterus and cervix.\\n• Stage III. Cancer has spread out of the uterus but is\\nrestricted to the pelvic region.\\n• Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or\\nother distant locations.\\nThe mainstay of treatment for most stages of\\nendometrial cancer is surgery.

This may be necessary because endometrial\\ncancer often spreads to the ovaries first. The lymph nodes\\nin the pelvic region may also be biopsied or removed to\\ncheck for metastasis. Hysterectomy is traditionally per-\\nformed through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy),\\nhowever, endoscopic surgery (laparoscopy) with vaginal\\nhysterectomy is also being used. Women with stage I dis-\\nease may require no further treatment. However, those\\nwith higher grade disease will receive adjuvant therapy.\\nRadiation therapy\\nThe decision to use radiation therapy depends on the\\nstage of the disease. Radiation therapy may be used\\nbefore surgery (preoperatively) and/or after surgery\\n(postoperatively). Radiation given from a machine that is\\noutside the body is called external radiation therapy.\\nSometimes applicators containing radioactive com-\\npounds are placed inside the vagina or uterus. This is\\ncalled internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy and\\nrequires hospitalization.\\nSide effects are common with radiation therapy. The\\nskin in the treated area may become red and dry.\\nFatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea , and nausea are also\\ncommon complaints. Radiation therapy in the pelvic area\\nmay cause the vagina to become narrow (vaginal steno-\\nsis), making intercourse painful. Premature menopause\\nand some problems with urination may also occur.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy is usually reserved for women with\\nstage IV or recurrent disease because this therapy is not a\\nvery effective treatment for endometrial cancer. The\\nanticancer drugsare given by mouth or intravenously.\\nSide effects include stomach upset, vomiting, appetite\\nloss, hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue, menstrual\\ncycle changes, and premature menopause. There is also\\nan increased chance of infections.\\nHormonal therapy\\nHormonal therapy uses drugs like progesterone to\\nslow the growth of endometrial cells. These drugs are\\nusually available as pills. This therapy is usually reserved\\nfor women with advanced or recurrent disease. Side\\neffects include fatigue, fluid retention, and appetite and\\nweight changes.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlthough alternative and complementary therapies are\\nused by many cancer patients, very few controlled studies\\non the effectiveness of such therapies exist. Mind-body\\ntechniques, such as prayer,biofeedback, visualization,\\nmeditation, and yoga, have not shown any effect in reduc-\\ning cancer, but they can reduce stress and lessen some of\\nthe side effects of cancer treatments. Clinical studies of\\nhydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect on cancer and\\neven worsened the health and well-being of the study sub-\\njects. One clinical study of the drug amygdalin (Laetrile)\\nfound that it had no effect on cancer. Laetrile can be toxic\\nand has caused deaths. Shark cartilage, although highly\\ntouted as an effective cancer treatment, is an improbable\\ntherapy that has not been the subject of clinical study.\\nThe American Cancer Society has found that the\\n“metabolic diets” pose serious risk to the patient. The\\neffectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelley diets\\nand the Manner metabolic therapy has not been scientifi-\\ncally proven. The FDA was unable to substantiate the anti-\\ncancer claims made about the popular Cancell treatment.\\nThere is no evidence for the effectiveness of most\\nover-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. Some herbals\\nhave shown an anticancer effect. As shown in clinical\\nstudies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mushroom\\nCoriolus versicolor, has significant effectiveness against\\ncancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella\\npyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity.\\nIn a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shown\\nsome benefit in the treatment of cancer.\\nPrognosis\\nBecause it is possible to detect endometrial cancer\\nearly, the chances of curing it are excellent. The five year\\nsurvival rates for endometrial cancer by stage are: 90%,\\nstage I; 60%, stage II; 40%, stage III; and 5%, stage IV .\\nEndometrial cancer most often spreads to the lungs, liver,\\nbones, brain, vagina, and certain lymph nodes.\\nPrevention\\nWomen (especially postmenopausal women) should\\nreport any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge to the\\ndoctor. Controlling obesity, blood pressure, and diabetes\\ncan help to reduce the risk of this disease. Women on\\nestrogen replacement therapy have a substantially\\nreduced risk of endometrial cancer if progestins are taken\\nsimultaneously. Long term use of birth control pills has\\nbeen shown to reduce the risk of this cancer. Women who\\nhave irregular periods may be prescribed birth control\\npills to help prevent endometrial cancer.

Like the uterine lining, this tis-\\nsue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonal\\ncycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blood\\ndiscarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur-\\nrounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. This\\nrepeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissue\\nand adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants.\\nDescription\\nEndometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of\\nchildbearing age in the United States. It most commonly\\nstrikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis can\\nalso appear in the teen years, but never before the start of\\nmenstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausal\\nwomen.\\nEndometriosis was once called the “career woman’s\\ndisease” because it was thought to be a product of\\ndelayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrow\\ngeneralization; however,pregnancy may slow the\\nprogress of the condition. A more important predictor of\\na woman’s risk is if her female relatives have endome-\\ntriosis. Another influencing factor is the length of a\\nwoman’s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods last\\nlonger than a week with an interval of less than 27 days\\nbetween them seem to be more prone to the condition.\\nEndometrial implants are most often found on the\\npelvic organs—the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and in\\nthe cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissue\\ngrows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms,\\nand kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as small\\nbumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga-\\nments and are sometimes said to look like “powder burns.”\\nOvarian cystsmay form around endometrial tissue\\n(endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruit\\nsize. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usually\\nadvances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctors\\nrank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such as\\nthe number and size of the endometrial implants, their\\nappearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissue\\nand adhesions in the vicinity of the growths.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of endometriosis is\\nunknown, a number of theories have been put forward.\\nSome of the more popular ones are:\\n• Implantation theory. Originally proposed in the 1920s,\\nthis theory states that a reversal in the direction of men-\\nstrual flow sends discarded endometrial cells into the\\nbody cavity where they attach to internal organs and\\nseed endometrial implants. There is considerable evi-\\ndence to support this explanation. Reversed menstrual\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1192\\nEndometriosis'),\n",

However,\\nmany women with reversed menstrual flow do not\\ndevelop endometriosis.\\n• Vascular-lymphatic theory. This theory suggests that\\nthe lymph system or blood vessels (vascular system) is\\nthe vehicle for the distribution of endometrial cells out\\nof the uterus.\\n• Coelomic metaplasia theory. According to this hypothe-\\nsis, remnants of tissue left over from prenatal develop-\\nment of the woman’s reproductive tract transforms into\\nendometrial cells throughout the body.\\n• Induction theory. This explanation postulates that an\\nunidentified substance found in the body forces cells\\nfrom the lining of the body cavity to change into\\nendometrial cells.\\nIn addition to these theories, the following factors are\\nthought to influence the development of endometriosis:\\n• Heredity. A woman’s chance of developing endometrio-\\nsis is seven times greater if her mother or sisters have\\nthe disease.\\n• Immune system function. Women with endometriosis\\nmay have lower functioning immune systems that have\\ntrouble eliminating stray endometrial cells. This would\\nexplain why a high percentage of women experience\\nreversed menstrual flow while relatively few develop\\nendometriosis.\\n• Dioxin exposure. Some research suggests a link\\nbetween the exposure to dioxin (TCCD), a toxic chemi-\\ncal found in weed killers, and the development of\\nendometriosis.\\nWhile many women with endometriosis suffer debil-\\nitating symptoms, others have the disease without know-\\ning it. Paradoxically, there does not seem to be any rela-\\ntion between the severity of the symptoms and the extent\\nof the disease. The most common symptoms are:\\n• Menstrual pain. Pain in the lower abdomen that begins\\na day or two before the menstrual period starts and con-\\ntinues through to the end is typical of endometriosis.\\nSome women also report lower back aches and pain\\nduring urination and bowel movement, especially dur-\\ning their periods.\\n• Painful sexual intercourse. Pressure on the vagina and\\ncervix causes severe pain for some women.\\n• Abnormal bleeding. Heavy menstrual periods, irregular\\nbleeding, and spotting are common features of\\nendometriosis.\\n• Infertility . There is a strong association between\\nendometriosis and infertility, although the reasons for\\nthis have not been fully explained. It is thought that\\nthe build up of scar tissue and adhesions blocks the\\nfallopian tubes and prevents the ovaries from releasing\\neggs. Endometriosis may also affect fertility by caus-\\ning hormonal irregularities and a higher rate of early\\nmiscarriage.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a doctor suspects endometriosis, the first step will\\nbe to perform a pelvic exam to try to feel if implants are\\npresent. Very often there is no strong evidence of\\nendometriosis from a physical exam. The only way to\\nmake a definitive diagnosis is through minor surgery\\ncalled a laparoscopy. A laparoscope, a slender scope with\\na light on the end, is inserted into the woman’s abdomen\\nthrough a small incision near her belly button. This allows\\nthe doctor to examine the internal organs for endometriotic\\ngrowths. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later exami-\\nnation in the laboratory. Endometriosis is sometimes dis-\\ncovered when a woman has abdominal surgery for another\\nreason such as tubal ligationor hysterectomy.\\nVarious imaging techniques such as ultrasound,\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic res-\\nonance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information\\nbut aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A blood\\ntest may also be ordered because women with\\nendometriosis have higher levels of the blood protein\\nCA125. Testing for this substance before and after treat-\\nment can predict a recurrence of the disease, but the test\\nis not reliable as a diagnostic tool.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1193\\nEndometriosis\\nAn endoscopic view of endometriosis on pelvic wall.(Cus-\\ntom Medical Stock Photo.

The condition cannot be\\nfully eradicated without surgery. Conservative treatment\\nfocuses on managing the pain, preserving fertility, and\\ndelaying the progress of the condition.\\nPain relief\\nOver-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin\\nand acetaminophen (Tylenol) are useful for mild\\ncramping and menstrual pain. Prescription-strength\\nand over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\\nand naproxen (Naprosyn), are also effective. If pain is\\nsevere, a doctor may prescribe narcotic medications,\\nalthough these can be addicting and are rarely used.\\nHormonal treatments\\nHormonal therapies effectively tame endometriosis\\nbut also act as contraceptives. A woman who is hoping to\\nbecome pregnant would take these medications for a\\nperiod of time, then try to conceive within several\\nmonths of discontinuing treatment.\\n• Oral contraceptives. Continuously taking estrogen-\\nprogestin pills tricks the body into thinking it is preg-\\nnant. This state of pseudopregnancy means reduced\\npelvic pain and a temporary withering of endometrial\\nimplants.\\n• Danazol (Danocrine) and gestrinone are synthetic male\\nhormones that lower estrogen levels, prevent menstrua-\\ntion, and shrink endometrial tissues. On the downside,\\nthey lead to weight gain and menopause-like symp-\\ntoms, and cause some women to develop masculine\\ncharacteristics.\\n• Progestins. Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) and\\nrelated drugs may also be used in treating endometrio-\\nsis. They have been proven effective in minimizing pain\\nand halting the progress of the condition, but are rarely\\nused because of the high rate of side effects.\\n• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) agonists.\\nThese estrogen-inhibiting drugs successfully limit pain\\nand prevent the growth of endometrial implants. They\\ncan cause menopause symptoms, however, and doses\\nhave to be regulated to prevent bone loss associated\\nwith low estrogen levels.\\nSurgery\\nRemoving the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes is\\nthe only permanent method of eliminating endometrio-\\nsis. This is an extreme measure that deprives a woman of\\nher ability to bear children and forces her body into\\nmenopause. Endometrial implants and ovarian cysts can\\nbe removed with laser surgery performed through a\\nlaparoscope. For women with minimal endometriosis,\\nthis technique is usually successful in reducing pain and\\nslowing the condition’s progress. It may also help infer-\\ntile women increase their chances of becoming pregnant.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlthough severe endometriosis should not be self-\\ntreated, many women find they can help their condition\\nthrough alternative therapies. Taking vitamin B complex\\ncombined with vitamins C, E, and the minerals calcium,\\nmagnesium, and selenium can help the depression and\\nlack of energy that may accompany endometriosis. B vit-\\namins also counteract the side effects of hormonal drugs.\\nOther women have found relief when they turned to a\\nmacrobiotic diet. Less extreme diets that cut out sugar,\\nsalt, and processed foods are sometimes helpful as well.\\nMind-body therapies such as relaxation and visualization\\nhelp women cope with pain. Other avenues to combat\\npain include acupuncture and biofeedback techniques.\\nStill other women report positive results after being treat-\\ned by chiropractors or homeopathic doctors.\\nPrognosis\\nMost women who have endometriosis have minimal\\nsymptoms and do well. Overall, endometriosis symp-\\ntoms come back in an average of 40% of women over the\\nfive years following treatment. With hormonal therapy,\\npain returned after five years in 37% of patients with\\nminimal symptoms and 74% of those with severe cases.\\nThe highest success rate from conservative treatment fol-\\nlowed complete removal of implants using laser surgery.\\nEighty percent of these women were still pain-free five\\nyears later. In cases that don’t respond to these treat-\\nments, a woman and her doctor may consider surgery to\\nremove her reproductive organs.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no proven way to prevent endometriosis.\\nOne study, however, indicated that girls who begin par-\\nticipating in aerobic exercise at a young age are less like-\\nly to develop the condition.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBreitkopf, Lyle J.

The pat-\\ntern of echoes as they bounce off tissues is converted into\\na picture (sonogram) on a television screen.\\nPurpose\\nERUS is used as a diagnostic procedure in rectal\\ncancer to determine stage of the tumor and as a postradi-\\nation, presurgical examination to assess extent of tumor\\nshrinkage. ERUS can also be used in cases of anal fistula\\n(an abnormal passage) and problems with the anal\\nsphincter muscles (muscles that control the opening and\\nclosing of the anus).\\nPrecautions\\nNormal precautions should be taken with any diag-\\nnostic procedure. Since the population in which this pro-\\ncedure is normally done is elderly, the imaging staff\\nshould be extra cautious about stressing the patient. The\\nprocedure is invasive and may be embarrassing to some.\\nOther patients may be anxious about their medical condi-\\ntion since endorectal ultrasounds are not routine. This\\nplaces an added burden on already stressed hearts and\\nnervous systems. Physicians, nurses, and technicians\\nmay need to be prepared for stress reactions that could\\ninclude the heart, asthma, or anxious behaviors.\\nDescription\\nERUS has been used as a means to determine the\\ndepth of rectal cancers and to assess whether the tumor\\nhas affected surrounding tissues. This pre-treatment pro-\\ncedure has proven to be an accurate tool for tailoring\\nsurgery for patients.\\nProblems with interpretation of the sonograms after\\nradiation and before surgery have resulted in tumors\\nbeing identified that were merely the formation of\\nfibrous tissues that remained after the tumors had been\\neliminated by the radiation. Yet, some of the fibrous\\nareas actually hid residual tumors. Rectal anatomy itself\\ncan affect the accuracy of ultrasound reading. This\\nmakes ERUS problematic in determining the amount of\\ntumor reduction a patient has after radiation therapy.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient must evacuate the bowels completely\\nbefore the procedure is done. This usually is assisted\\nthough the use of several enemas. The patient may be\\ntold to adhere to a liquid diet the day prior to doing this\\nprocedure. The probe is inserted, usually with little dis-\\ncomfort for the patient since it will only be examining\\nthe first few inches of the colon.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1195\\nEndorectal ultrasound'),\n",

This\\nprocedure was developed to examine abnormalities of\\nthe bile ducts, pancreas, and gallbladder. It was devel-\\noped during the late 1960s and is used today to diagnose\\nand treat blockages of the bile and pancreatic ducts.\\nThe term has three parts to its definition:\\n• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope\\n• retrograde refers to the injection of dye up into the bile\\nducts in a direction opposing, or against, the normal\\nflow of bile down the ducts\\n• cholangiopancreatography means visualization of the\\nbile ducts (cholangio) and pancreas (pancreato)\\nPurpose\\nUntil the 1970s, methods to visualize the bile ducts\\nproduced images that were of relatively poor quality and\\noften misleading; in addition, the pancreatic duct could\\nnot be examined at all. Patients with symptoms related to\\nthe bile ducts or pancreatic ducts frequently needed\\nsurgery to diagnose and treat their conditions.\\nUsing ERCP, physicians can obtain high-quality x\\nrays of these structures and identify areas of narrowing\\n(strictures), cancers, and gallstones. This procedure can\\nhelp determine whether bile or pancreatic ducts are\\nblocked; it also identifies where they are blocked along\\nwith the cause of the blockage. ERCP may then be used\\nto relieve the blockage. For patients requiring surgery or\\nadditional procedures for treatment, ERCP outlines the\\nanatomical changes for the surgeon.\\nPrecautions\\nThe most important precaution is that the examina-\\ntion should be performed by an experienced physician.\\nThe procedure is much more technically difficult than\\nmany other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies.

The procedure\\nwas developed as an extension to the diagnostic examina-\\ntion, ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-\\natography); with the addition of “sphincterotomy,”\\nabnormalities found during the study could be treated at\\nthe same time without the need for invasive surgery.\\nThe term ERS has three parts to its definition;\\n• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope\\n• retrograde refers to the insertion of the endoscope up\\ninto the ducts in a direction opposite to or against the\\nnormal flow of bile down the ducts\\n• sphincterotomy, which means cutting of the sphincter\\nor muscle that lies at the juncture of the intestine with\\nboth the bile and pancreatic ducts\\nPurpose\\nUntil the 1970s, patients with symptoms related to\\ndisease of the bile ducts or pancreas frequently needed\\nsurgery to diagnose the cause and treat any abnormali-\\nties. ERCP allowed physicians for the first time to obtain\\nhigh quality x rays of the common bile and pancreatic\\nducts, and detect areas of narrowing (strictures), stones,\\nand tumors. ERCP was not initially designed for treat-\\nment. ERS was developed shortly after and enabled\\nphysicians to treat the abnormalities identified by the\\ninjection of dye and x rays.\\nThe revolutionary technique made possible the\\nendoscopic removal of stones and stretching of areas of\\nnarrowing (strictures). It has since been expanded to\\ninclude drainage of bile from blocked ducts and treat-\\nment of various abnormalities of the pancreas.\\nPrecautions\\nThe most important precaution related to both ERCP\\nand ERS is to have the procedure performed by an expe-\\nrienced physician. ERS is technically more difficult than\\nmany other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies, including\\nERCP. Patients should inquire as to the physician’s expe-\\nrience with the procedure. The physician should also be\\ninformed of any allergies , medication use, and medical\\nproblems.\\nDescription\\nERS is generally performed only after ERCP has\\nbeen successfully accomplished and detail of the anato-\\nmy and abnormalities is known. During ERS, a number\\nof various instruments are inserted through the endo-\\nscope in order to “cut” or stretch the sphincter. Once this\\nis done, additional instruments are passed that enable the\\nremoval of stones and the stretching of narrowed regions\\nof the ducts. Drains (stents) can also be used to prevent a\\nnarrowed area from rapidly returning to its previously\\nnarrowed state.\\nPreparation\\nThe upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-\\ncedure, so patients must not eat or drink for at least six to\\n12 hours before the exam. Patients need to inquire about\\ntaking their medications before the procedure. Some\\npatients may require antibiotics before and/or after the\\nprocedure. When possible, aspirin or NSAIDS should\\nnot be taken within several days before the procedure,\\nbecause they interfere with blood clotting.\\nAftercare\\nWhen ERS is performed, physicians will usually\\nwant to observe the patient closely for several hours to\\nensure that there are no signs of complications. Pain or\\nany other unusual symptoms should be reported. Admis-\\nsion to the hospital may be advised.\\nRisks\\nERS complications are related either to the drugs\\nused during the procedure, or the results of dye injection\\nor cutting of tissue.

When the enema\\nis administered, the individual is usually lying on the left\\nside, which places the sigmoid colon (lower portion of\\nbowel) below the rectum and facilitates infusion of fluid.\\nThe length of time it takes to administer an enema\\ndepends on the amount of fluid to be infused. The\\namount of fluid administered will vary depending on the\\nage and size of the person receiving the enema, however\\ngeneral guidelines would be:\\n• Infant: 250 cc or less\\n• Toddler and preschooler: 500 cc or less\\n• School-aged child: 500–1,000 cc\\n• Adult: 750–1,000 cc\\nSome may differentiate between high and low ene-\\nmas. A high enema, given to cleanse as much of the large\\nbowel as possible, is usually administered at higher pres-\\nsure and with larger volume (1,000 cc), and the individ-\\nual changes position several times in order for the fluid\\nto flow up into the bowel. A low enema, intended to\\ncleanse only the lower bowel, is administered at lower\\npressure, using about 500 cc of fluid.\\nOil retention enemas serve to lubricate the rectum\\nand lower bowel, and soften the stool. For adults, about\\n150–200 cc of oil is instilled, while in small children,\\n75–150 cc of oil is considered adequate. Salad oil or liq-\\nuid petrolatum are commonly used at a temperature of\\n91°F (32.8°C). There are also commercially prepared oil\\nretention enemas. The oil is usually retained for one to\\nthree hours before it is expelled.\\nThe rectal tube used for infusion of the solution,\\nusually made of rubber or plastic, has two or more\\nopenings at the end through which the solution can flow\\ninto the bowel. The distance to which the tube must be\\ninserted is dependent upon the age and size of the\\npatient. For adult, insertion is usually 3–4 in (7.5–10\\ncm); for children, approximately 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm); and\\nfor infants, only 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.75 cm).

The small intestine is about 20 ft (6.1 m) long\\nand the large intestine, about 5 ft (1.5 m) long.\\nRectum—The portion of bowel just before the anus.\\nThe prefix recto is used with a variety of words in\\nrelation to conditions that affect the rectum.\\nmore difficult by narrowing the urethra, a tube running\\nfrom the bladder through the prostate gland. It can be\\neffectively treated by surgery and, today, by certain\\ndrugs.\\nDescription\\nThe common term for enlarged prostate is BPH,\\nwhich stands for benign (non-cancerous) prostatic\\nhyperplasia or hypertrophy. Hyperplasia means that the\\nprostate cells are dividing too rapidly, increasing the\\ntotal number of cells, and, therefore, the size of the\\norgan itself. Hypertrophy simply means “enlargement.”\\nBPH is part of the aging process. The actual changes in\\nthe prostate may start as early as the 30s but take place\\nvery gradually, so that significant enlargement and\\nsymptoms usually do not appear until after age 50. Past\\nthis age the chances of the prostate enlarging and caus-\\ning urinary symptoms become progressively greater.\\nMore than 40% of men in their 70s have an enlarged\\nprostate. Symptoms generally appear between ages\\n55–75. About 10% of all men eventually will require\\ntreatment for BPH.\\nBPH has been viewed as a rare condition in African,\\nChinese and other Asian peoples for reasons that are not\\nclear.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of BPH is a mystery, but age-related\\nchanges in the levels of hormones circulating in the\\nblood may be a factor. Whatever the cause, an enlarging\\nprostate gradually narrows the urethra and obstructs the\\nflow of urine. Even though the muscle in the bladder wall\\nbecomes stronger in an attempt to push urine through the\\nsmaller urethra, in time, the bladder fails to empty com-\\npletely at each urination. The urine that collects in the\\nbladder can become infected and lead to stone formation.\\nThe kidneys themselves may be damaged by infection or\\nby urine constantly “backing up.”\\nWhen the enlarging prostate gland narrows the ure-\\nthra, a man will have increasing trouble starting the urine\\nstream. Because some urine remains behind in the blad-\\nder, he will have to urinate more often, perhaps two or\\nthree times at night (nocturia). The need to urinate can\\nbecome very urgent and, in time, urine may dribble out\\nto stain a man’s clothing. Other symptoms of BPH are a\\nweak and sometimes a split stream and general aching or\\npainin the perineum (the area between the scrotum and\\nanus). Some men may have considerable enlargement of\\nthe prostate before even mild symptoms develop.\\nIf a man must strain hard to force out the urine,\\nsmall veins in the bladder wall and urethra may rupture,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1201\\nEnlarged prostate'),\n",

If the urinary stream\\nbecomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad-\\nder may cause severe discomfort, a condition called\\nacute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad-\\nder can easily become infected. A burning feeling during\\nurination and fever are clues that infection may have\\ndeveloped. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may\\nincrease pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus-\\nes permanent kidney damage.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a man’s symptoms point to BPH, the first\\nthing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal\\nexamination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel\\nwhether—and how much—the prostate is enlarged. A\\nsmooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis-\\ntinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer .\\nThe next step is a blood test for a substance called\\nprostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30–50% of\\nmen with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does\\nnot mean cancer by any means, but other measures\\nare needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement\\nis in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate,\\nwhich is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can\\nshow whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer\\nis present.\\nIf digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate\\nraises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec-\\nommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This\\nis usually done using a lance-like instrument that is\\ninserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and,\\nguided by the physcian’s finger, obtains six to eight\\npieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory\\nfor microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the\\nprognosis and treatment are changed accordingly.\\nA catheter placed through the urethra and into the\\nbladder can show how much urine remains in the bladder\\nafter the patient urinates—a measure of how severe the\\nobstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc-\\ntion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter,\\nwhich measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain—\\nthough invasive—way of confirming obstruction from an\\nenlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument\\ncalled a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often\\nnecessary.\\nIt is routine to check a urine sample for an increased\\nnumber of white blood cells, which may mean there is\\ninfection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample\\nmay be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus-\\ning the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.\\nThe state of the kidneys may be checked in two ways:\\nimaging by either ultrasound or injecting a dye (the intra-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1202\\nEnlarged prostate\\nEnlarged \\nprostate\\ngland\\nUreter\\nProstate\\ngland\\nUrine retention in bladder\\nConstricted\\nurethra\\nNormal sized prostate gland Enlarged prostate gland\\nAn enlarged prostate is a non-cancerous condition in which the narrowing of the urethra makes the elimination of urine more\\ndifficult.

These drugs improve obstructive symptoms, but do\\nnot keep the prostate from enlarging. Other drugs (finas-\\nteride is a good example) do shrink the prostate and may\\ndelay the need for surgery. Symptoms may not, however,\\nimprove until the drug has been used for three months or\\nlonger. Antibiotic drugs are given promptly whenever\\ninfection is diagnosed. Some medications, including anti-\\nhistamines and some decongestants , can make the\\nsymptoms of BPH suddenly worse and even cause acute\\nurinary retention, and therefore should be avoided.\\nIntermediate treatments\\nWhen drugs have failed to control symptoms of\\nBPH but the physician does not believe that conventional\\nsurgery is yet needed, a procedure called transurethral\\nneedle ablation may be tried. In the office and using local\\nanesthesia, a needle is inserted into the prostate and\\nradiofrequency energy is applied to destroy the tissue\\nthat is obstructing urine flow. Another new approach is\\nmicrowave hyperthermia, using a device called the\\nProstatron to deliver microwave energy to the prostate\\nthrough a catheter. This procedure is done at an outpa-\\ntient surgery center.\\nSurgery\\nFor many years the standard operation for BPH has\\nbeen transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Under\\ngeneral or spinal anesthesia, a cystoscope is passed\\nthrough the urethra and prostate tissue surrounding the\\nurethra is removed using either a cutting instrument or a\\nheated wire loop. The small pieces of prostate tissue are\\nwashed out through the scope. No incision is needed for\\nTUR. There normally is some blood in the urine for a\\nfew days following the procedure. In a few men—less\\nthan 5% of all those having TUR—urine will continue to\\nescape unintentionally. Other uncommon complications\\ninclude a temporary rise in blood pressure with mental\\nconfusion, which is treated by giving salt solution. Impo-\\ntence—the inability to achieve lasting penile erections—\\ndoes occur, but probably in fewer than 10% of patients. A\\nnarrowing or stricture rarely develops in the urethra, but\\nthis can be treated fairly easily.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCatheter—A rubber or plastic tube placed through\\nthe urethra into the bladder to remove excess\\nurine when the flow of urine is cut off, or to pre-\\nvent urinary infection.\\nCreatinine—One of the “waste” substances nor-\\nmally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.\\nWhen urine flow is slowed, creatinine may collect\\nin the blood and cause toxic effects.\\nHyperplasia—A condition where cells, such as\\nthose making up the prostate gland, rapidly divide\\nabnormally and cause the organ to become\\nenlarged.\\nHypertrophy—A technical term for enlargement,\\nas in BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy).\\nUrethra—In males, the tube that conducts urine\\nfrom the bladder through the penis to the outside\\nof the body.

The procedure is done in an operating\\nroom, and several patients have retained urine postoper-\\natively.\\n• Transurethral incision of the prostate.

This is\\nequally successful but patients usually can leave the\\nhospital within 24 hours, and there is less blood loss.\\n• If the prostate is greatly enlarged—as is the case in\\nabout 5–10% of those diagnosed, an incision is made to\\nperform an open prostatectomy , removing the entire\\ngland under direct vision.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1203\\nEnlarged prostate'),\n",

Gram-negative means that the organisms do not\\nretain the violet color of the dye used to make Gram\\nstains. The most troublesome organism in this group is\\nEscherichia coli. Other enterobacteria are species of Sal-\\nmonella , Shigella , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Serratia ,\\nProteus, and Yersinia.\\nDescription\\nEnterobacterial infections can be produced by bacte-\\nria that normally live in the human digestive tract without\\ncausing serious disease, or by bacteria that enter from the\\noutside. In many cases these infections are nosocomial,\\nwhich means that they can be acquired in the hospital.\\nKlebsiellaand Proteus sometimes cause pneumonia, ear\\nand sinus infections, and urinary tract infections. Enter-\\nobacter and Serratia often cause bacterial infection of\\nthe blood ( bacteremia ), particularly in patients with\\nweakened immune systems.\\nDiarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common\\nproblem in the United States. It is estimated that each\\nperson in the general population has an average of 1.5\\nepisodes of diarrhea each year, with higher rates in chil-\\ndren, institutionalized people, and Native Americans.\\nThis type of enterobacterial infection can range from a\\nminor nuisance to a life-threatening disorder, especially\\nin infants, elderly persons,AIDS patients, and malnour-\\nished people. Enterobacterial infections are one of the\\ntwo leading killers of children in developing countries.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nEnterobacterial infections in the digestive tract typi-\\ncally start when the organisms invade the mucous tissues\\nthat line the digestive tract.

It is\\nalso possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by\\nperson-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is\\n12–72 hours.\\nESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections\\ncause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United\\nStates. The organisms are categorized according to\\nwhether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive\\ntypes of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic\\nE. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC.\\nEPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin)\\nin the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and\\ncauses the patient to lose large amounts of water through\\nthe intestines.\\nThe invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor-\\nrhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or\\nEIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct-\\nly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC\\ncan produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic\\nsyndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by\\nthe destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure.\\nEHEC has become a growing problem in the United\\nStates because of outbreaks caused by contaminated\\nfood. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has\\nbeen identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers,\\nunpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2–7% of\\ninfections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of enterobacterial infections are\\nsometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea\\nthey produce.\\nWATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC,\\nEPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of\\nShigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are\\nlocated in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins\\ninteracting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma-\\ntion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics.\\nBLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea\\nis sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC,\\nEIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella,\\nand Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the\\ncolon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is\\npresent, and antibiotic therapy is usually required.\\nNECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing\\nenterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn\\ninfants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully\\nunderstood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or\\nviral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease\\norganisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis-\\nsue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease\\nof prematurity ; 60–80% of cases occur in high-risk\\npreterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2–5% of cases in\\nnewborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae\\nthat have been identified in infants with NEC include\\nSalmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history\\nThe diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com-\\nplicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other\\ntypes of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases\\nof mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism\\nbecause the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of\\npatients, however, should have stool tests. They include:\\n• patients with bloody diarrhea,\\n• patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy-\\ndrated,\\n• patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than\\nthree days without decreasing in amount,\\n• patients with disorders of the immune system.\\nThe patient history is useful for public health reasons\\nas well as helping the doctor determine what type of\\nenterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor\\nwill ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar-\\nrhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is\\nnauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be\\nlocated in the small intestine. If the patient is running a\\nfever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor\\nwill also ask if anyone else in the patient’s family or\\nworkplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are\\nmore likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other\\nquestions include the patient’s food intake over the last\\nfew days and whether he or she has recently traveled to\\ncountries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks.\\nPhysical examination\\nThe most important parts of the physical examina-\\ntion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam-\\nining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor\\nwill look at the inside of the patient’s mouth and evaluate\\nthe skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin\\nrash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a\\nbacterial infection. If the patient’s abdomen hurts when the\\ndoctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe most common test that is used to identify the\\ncause of diarrhea is the stool test.

Empiric means that the doctor treats the\\npatient on the basis of the visible symptoms and profes-\\nsional experience in treating infections, without waiting\\nfor laboratory test results.

Most\\nalternative practitioners advise consulting a medical doc-\\ntor if the patient has sunken eyes, dry eyes or mouth, or\\nother signs of dehydration.\\nHerbal medicine\\nHerbalists may recommend cloves taken as an infu-\\nsion or ginger given in drop doses to control intestinal\\ncramps, eliminate gas, and prevent vomiting.

Frey\\nEnterobiasis\\nDefinition\\nEnterobiasis, or pinworm infection as it is common-\\nly called, is an intestinal infection caused by the parasitic\\nroundworm called Enterobius vermicularis . The most\\ncommon symptom of this irritating, but not particularly\\ndangerous, disease is itching around the anal area.\\nDescription\\nEnterobiasis is also called seatworm infection or\\noxyuriasis. In the United States, enterobiasis is the most\\ncommon worm infection, and some estimate that approx-\\nimately 10% of the United States population is infected.\\nWorldwide, approximately 200 million people are infect-\\ned. Enterobiasis can affect people of any age, but is most\\ncommon among children ages 5–14 and particularly\\naffects those in the daycare setting.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe disease is highly contagious and is caused by a\\nparasitic worm called Enterobius vermicularis. The adult\\nfemale worm is about the size of a staple (approximately\\n0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has a\\npointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting the\\neggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes-\\ntine where, after approximately one month, they hatch\\nand mature into adult worms. During the night, the\\nfemale adult worms travel to the area around the anus\\nand deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A single\\nfemale pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after laying\\neggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infection\\nafter six hours at body temperature.\\nSignificant itching in the anal region is caused by the\\nmovement of the adult worm as the eggs are deposited.\\nWhen an individual scratches the anal region, the tiny eggs\\nget under the finger nails and in the underwear and night\\nclothes. Anything the individual touches with the contami-\\nnated fingers, for example, toys, bedding, blankets, bath-\\nroom door knobs, or sinks, becomes contaminated. The\\neggs are very hardy and can live on surfaces for two to\\nthree weeks. Anyone touching these contaminated sur-\\nfaces can ingest the eggs and become infected.

When present, however, symptoms of the infection\\nbegin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin-\\nworm eggs. The main symptom is itching around the\\nanus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when the\\nfemale worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it often\\nleads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping at\\nnight in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa-\\nsionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruising\\nin the region, and secondary bacterial infections can\\noccur. In females, the itching may spread to the vagina\\nand sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region\\n(vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months.\\nDiagnosis\\nFirst, a physician will rule out other potential causes\\nof the itching, such as hemorrhoids , lice, or fungal or\\nbacterial infection. Once these have been ruled out, an\\naccurate diagnosis of enterobiasis will require that either\\nthe eggs or the adult worms are detected.

The opening is called a stoma,\\nfrom the Greek word for mouth. Enterostomies may be\\neither temporary or permanent. They are classified accord-\\ning to the part of the intestine that is used to create the\\nstoma. If the ileum, which is the lowest of the three sec-\\ntions of the small intestine, is used to make the stoma, the\\noperation is called an ileostomy. If the jejunum, which is\\nthe middle section of the small intestine, is used, the oper-\\nation is called a jejunostomy. Some people use the word\\nostomyas a word that covers all types of enterostomies.\\nPurpose\\nEnterostomies are performed in order to create a\\nnew opening for the passage of fecal matter when normal\\nintestinal functioning is interrupted or when diseases of\\nthe intestines cannot be treated by medications or less\\nradical surgery. Some situations that may require entero-\\nstomies include:\\n• Healing of inflamed bowel segments. Enterostomies\\nperformed for this reason are usually temporary.\\n• Emergency treatment of gunshot or other penetrating\\nwounds of the abdomen. An enterostomy is needed to\\nprevent the contents of the intestine from causing a seri-\\nous inflammation of the inside of the abdominal cavity\\n(peritonitis ). These enterostomies are also often tem-\\nporary.\\n• Placement of a tube for enteral feeding. Enteral feeding\\nis a method for conveying nutritional solutions directly\\ninto the stomach or jejunum through a tube. Tube\\nenterostomies may be long-term but are not permanent.\\n• Removal of diseased sections of the intestines.\\nIleostomies performed for this reason are permanent.\\nThe most common disorders requiring permanent\\nileostomy are Crohn’s disease, familial polyposis, and\\nulcerative colitis . Familial polyposis and ulcerative\\ncolitis are serious health risks because they can develop\\ninto cancer.\\n• Treatment of advanced cancer or other causes of intesti-\\nnal obstruction.\\nPrecautions\\nEnterostomies are usually performed only as emer-\\ngency treatments for traumatic injuries in the abdomen or\\nas final measures for serious disorders of the intestines.\\nMost patients do not refuse to have the operation per-\\nformed when the need for it is explained to them. A small\\nminority, however, refuse enterostomies because of\\nstrong psychological reactions to personal disfigurement\\nand the need to relearn bowel habits.\\nDescription\\nIleostomy\\nIleostomies represent about 25% of enterostomies.\\nThey are performed after the surgeon removes a diseased\\ncolon and sometimes the rectum as well. The most com-\\nmon ileostomy is called a Brooke ileostomy after the\\nEnglish surgeon who developed it. In a Brooke ileosto-\\nmy, the surgeon makes the stoma in the lower right sec-\\ntion of the abdomen. The ileum is pulled through an\\nopening (incision) in the muscle layer. The surgeon then\\nturns the cut end of the intestine inside out and sews it to\\nthe edges of the hole. He or she then positions an appli-\\nance for collecting the fecal material. The appliance con-\\nsists of a plastic bag that fits over the stoma and lies flat\\nagainst the abdomen. The patient is taught to drain the\\nbag from time to time during the day. Ileostomies need to\\nbe emptied frequently because the digested food contains\\nlarge amounts of water. Shortly after the operation, the\\nileostomy produces 1–2 qt (0.9–1.91) of fluid per day;\\nafter a month or two of adjustment, the volume decreases\\nto 1–2 pt (0.5–0.9)per day.\\nKOCK POUCH (CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY). The Kock\\npouch is a variation of the basic ileostomy and is named\\nfor its Swedish inventor. In the Kock technique, the sur-\\ngeon forms a pouch inside the abdominal cavity behind\\nthe stoma that collects the fecal material. The stoma is\\nshaped into a valve to prevent fluid from leaking onto the\\npatient’s abdomen. The patient then empties the pouch\\nseveral times daily by inserting a tube (catheter) through\\nthe valve. The Kock technique is sometimes called a con-\\ntinent ileostomy because the fluid is contained inside the\\nabdomen. It is successful in 70–90% of patients who\\nhave it done.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1209\\nEnterostomy'),\n",

They are\\nfound worldwide, but infection is more common in areas\\nof poor hygiene and overcrowding.\\nAlthough most cases of enterovirus do not produce\\nsymptoms, some five to 10 million individuals in the Unit-\\ned States each year suffer from one of the enteroviral dis-\\neases. Illness is more common in the very young. While\\nthere are close to seventy different strains of enteroviruses,\\nover 70% of infections are caused by only 10 types.\\nThe virus is most commonly transmitted by the\\nfecal-oral route (contamination of fingers or objects by\\nhuman waste material); in some instances transmission is\\nthrough contaminated food or water. Passage of some\\nstrains of virus by way of air droplets can lead to respira-\\ntory illness. Infection of fetuses by way of the placenta\\nhas also been documented. Breast milk contains antibod-\\nies which can protect newborns.\\nThe incubation period for most enteroviruses ranges\\nfrom two to 14 days. In areas of temperate climate, infec-\\ntions occur mainly in the summer and fall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEnteroviruses are believed to be the cause of at least\\n10 distinct illnesses. Once they enter the body, they mul-\\ntiply in the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, and\\neventually reach sites of lymphatic tissue (such as the\\ntonsils). While most of these diseases are of short dura-\\ntion and do not cause significant injury, some can pro-\\nduce severe illness.\\nThe main syndromes caused by the various entero-\\nviruses are the following:\\n• Summer grippe (nonspecific febrile illness). This is the\\nmost common syndrome, and is characterized by flu-\\nlike symptoms of fever, headache, and weakness, that\\ntypically last three to four days. Many patients also\\ndevelop upper respiratory symptoms and some nausea\\nand vomiting . One of the major ways to distinguish\\nthis disease from influenza, is the fact that grippe most\\noften occurs in the summer.\\n• Generalized disease of the newborn is a potentially\\nserious infection in which infants from one week to\\nthree months of age develop a syndrome that can be\\ndifficult to distinguish from a severe bacterial infection.\\nFever, irritability, and decreased responsiveness or\\nexcessive sleepiness are the major symptoms. Inflam-\\nmation of heart muscle (myocarditis), low blood pres-\\nsure, hepatitis, and meningitis sometimes complicate\\nthe illness.\\n• Aseptic meningitis encephalitis is a well known syn-\\ndrome caused by this group of viruses. In fact,\\nenteroviruses are responsible for over 90% of cases of\\naseptic meningitis, and most often hits children and\\nyoung adults. Headache, fever, avoidance of light, and\\neye pain are characteristic. Drowsiness may be promi-\\nnent, and other symptoms include sore throat, cough,\\nmuscle pain, and rash. Occasionally, not only the\\nmeninges—the covering around the brain and spinal\\ncord— is infected, but also brain tissue itself, produc-\\ning encephalitis. The illness resolves after about a week\\nor so, and permanent damage is unusual. Enteroviruses\\ncan also produce the Guillian-Barré syndrome, which\\ninvolves weakness and paralysis of the extremities and\\neven the muscles of respiration.\\n• Pleurodynia (Bornholm’s disease) is due to viral infec-\\ntion and inflammation of the chest and abdominal mus-\\ncles used for breathing. Pain occurs as acute episodes,\\nlasting 30 minutes or so. Coxsackie B virus is the usual\\ncause of the illness.\\n• Myocarditis and/or pericarditis involves infection of\\nthe heart muscle (myocardium) and the covering\\naround the heart (pericardium). Infants and young\\nadults are the most susceptible, and for some reason,\\nover two-thirds of cases occur in males. The disease\\nusually begins as an upper respiratory tract infection\\nwith cough,shortness of breath, and fever. Chest pain,\\nincreasing shortness of breath, irregularities of cardiac\\nrhythm, and heart failure sometimes develop. Some\\npatients wind up with long term heart failure if the heart\\nmuscle is significantly affected.\\n• Exanthems is the medical term for rashes, and\\nenterovirus is the number one cause of summer and fall\\nrashes in children. They occur anywhere on the body,\\nand often resemble diseases such as measles.\\n• Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs initially as a sore\\nthroat (often involving the tongue as well), and is fol-\\nlowed by a rash on the hands, and sometimes the feet.\\nThe rash often forms small blisters, which lead to\\nulcers. Symptoms generally resolve within a week. A\\nspecific Coxsackievirus (A16) is the most frequent\\ncause of this highly infectious disease.\\n• Herpangina is most often caused by one of the Cox-\\nsackie A viruses, and appears as the acute onset of fever\\nand sore throat. This last symptom is particularly\\nsevere, as the virus produces multiple ulcers in the\\nthroat. Swallowing becomes very painful; symptoms\\ncan persist for several weeks.\\n• Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves viral infec-\\ntion of the conjunctiva, which is a covering around the\\neye.

It is clear then\\nthat these viruses produce a number of various illnesses,\\nmost often in younger age groups.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the\\ncharacteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such as\\nthe chest pain in pleurodynia).

Cultures from other areas, such\\nas the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virus\\nmay remain for long periods of time in places with a large\\namount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done early\\nin the illness are more likely to identify the virus.\\nNew techniques that involve identification of viral\\ngenetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but are\\nnot indicated for routine testing.\\nTreatment\\nAs noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking\\nmany different organs and producing a variety of symp-\\ntoms.

The\\nbody manufactures several thousands of enzymes.\\nAmong them are the digestive enzymes produced by the\\nstomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the salivary\\nglands of the mouth. Their energy-producing properties\\nare responsible for not only the digestion of nutrients, but\\ntheir absorption, transportation, metabolization, and\\nelimination as well.\\nEnzyme therapy is based on the work of Dr. Edward\\nHowell in the 1920s and 1930s. Howell proposed that\\nenzymes from foods work in the stomach to pre-digest\\nfood.

Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterized\\nby a large number of eosinophils in the lungs, usually in\\nthe absence of an infectious disease. Eosinophils are\\none of the white blood cells and are classified as a gran-\\nulocyte. They are part of the non-specific immune sys-\\ntem and participate in inflammatory reactions.\\nEosinophils contain cationic molecules that are useful\\nfor destroying infectious agents, especially heiminthic\\nparasites (worms). There are several types of\\neosinophilic pneumonia. Loffler’s pneumonia is a tem-\\nporary infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. The\\npatient will feel tired, have a cough , spasms of the\\nbronchial airway, and difficulty breathing. Loffler’s\\npneumonia will clear spontaneously, but slowly over\\nthe course of about a month. Another form of\\neosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates with\\neosinophilia (PIE), is a more serious and potentially\\nfatal disease. In PIE, the patient experiences asthma ,\\npulmonary infiltrates, disorders of the peripheral ner-\\nvous system, central nervous systems symptoms, and\\nperiarteritis nodosa.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPneumonia with eosinophils occurs as part of a\\nhypersensitivity reaction. A hypersensitivity reaction\\nis an over-reaction of the immune system to a particu-\\nlar stimulus. As part of the hypersensitive reaction,\\ncells of the immune system are produced in increased\\nnumbers and migrate into areas targeted by the hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. In the case of eosinophilic pneu-\\nmonia, the lungs are the target. Generally, eosinophilia\\npneumonia is not a reaction to an infection. There is a\\ncorrelation between asthma and eosinophilic pneumo-\\nnia. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also be caused by\\ndrugs and, in some people, by polluted air. The symp-\\ntoms range from mild (coughing,wheezing , and\\nshortness of breath ) to severe and life threatening\\n(severe shortness of breath and difficulty getting\\nenough oxygen). The symptoms may resolve sponta-\\nneously or can persist for long periods of time. In a\\nfew cases, the disease may rapidly produce life-threat-\\nening pneumonia.\\nKEY TERMS\\nInfiltrates —Cells or body fluids that have passed\\ninto a tissue or body cavity.\\nSputum—Material coughed up from the throat or\\nlungs.\\nDiagnosis\\nSince eosinophilia is common to a number of condi-\\ntions, the physician must rule out asthma and infection\\nby helminths when diagnosing eosinophilic pneumonia.\\nA whole blood count will reveal an increased number of\\neosinophils in the blood. An x ray of the lungs may show\\nthe presence of infiltrates (the eosinophils and fluid). If\\nsputum is produced in coughing, eosinophils will be seen\\ninstead of the more normal profile of granulocytes seen\\nwhen an infectious agent is present.\\nTreatment\\nEosinophilic pneumonia may not respond to drugs\\nused to treat asthma. Eosinophilic pneumonia is usually\\ntreated with steroids, particularly glucocorticosteroids.\\nSteroids are not effective against infectious agents, but\\nthe main disease process in eosinophilic pneumonia is an\\ninflammatory reaction, not a response to infection. When\\neosinophilia is produced as a consequence of asthma or\\nan infection by helminths, treatment of the asthma or\\nhelminths will reduce the eosinophilia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

Blistering\\noften appears in infancy in response to simply being held or\\nhandled. In rarer forms of the disorder, EB can be life-\\nthreatening. There is no cure for the disorder. Treatment\\nfocuses on preventing and treating woundsand infection.\\nDescription\\nEpidermolysis bullosa has three major forms and at\\nleast 16 subtypes. The three major forms are EB simplex,\\njunctional EB, and dystrophic EB. These can range in\\nseverity from mild blistering to more disfiguring and life-\\nthreatening disease. Physicians diagnose the form of the\\ndisease based on where the blister forms in relation to the\\nepidermis (the skin’s outermost layer) and the deeper\\ndermis layer.\\nThe prevalence of epidermolysis varies among dif-\\nferent populations. A study in Scotland estimated the\\nprevalence to be one in 20,400. Researchers in other\\nparts of the world estimate the prevalence to be one in\\n100,000. This variance is due to the variability of expres-\\nsion. Many cases of epidermolysis bullosa are often not\\naccurately diagnosed and thus, are not reported.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEB can be inherited as the result of a dominant\\ngenetic abnormality (only one parent carries the abnor-\\nmal gene) or a recessive genetic abnormality (both par-\\nents carry the abnormal gene).\\nEB simplex results from mutations in genes respon-\\nsible for keratin 5 and 14, which are proteins that give\\ncells of the epidermis its structure. EB simplex is trans-\\nmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.\\nDystrophic EB is caused by mutations in genes for\\ntype VII collagen, the protein contained in the fibers\\nanchoring the epidermis to the deeper layers of the skin.\\nThe genetic mutations for junctional EB are found in the\\ngenes responsible for producing the protein Laminin-5.\\nDystrophic EB is an autosomal disorder and will only\\nresult if both parents transmit an abnormal gene during\\nconception.\\nEB simplex, the most common form of EB, is the\\nleast serious form of the disease. In most affected indi-\\nviduals, the blisters are mild and do not scar after they\\nheal. Some forms of EB simplex affect just the hands and\\nKEY TERMS\\nCollagen —The main supportive protein of carti-\\nlage, connective tissue, tendon, skin, and bone.\\nDermis—The layer of skin beneath the epidermis.\\nEpidermis—The outermost layer of the skin.\\nKeratin—A tough, nonwater-soluble protein found\\nin the nails, hair, and the outermost layer of skin.\\nHuman hair is made up largely of keratin.\\nfeet. Other forms of EB simplex can lead to more wide-\\nspread blistering, as well as hair loss and missing teeth.\\nRecurrent blistering is annoying but not life threatening.\\nThe second, or junctional, form of EB does not lead to\\nscarring. However, skin on the areas prone to blistering,\\nsuch as elbows and knees, often shrinks. In one variation\\nof junctional EB, called gravis junctional EB of Herlitz,\\nthe blistering can be so severe that affected infants may not\\nsurvive due to massive infection and dehydration.\\nThe third form of EB, dystrophic EB, varies greatly\\nin terms of severity, but more typically affects the arms\\nand legs. In one variation, called Hallopeau-Siemens EB,\\nrepeated blistering and scarring of the hands and feet\\ncauses the fingers and toes to fuse, leaving them dysfunc-\\ntional and with a mitten-like appearance.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians and researchers distinguish between the\\nthree major subtypes of EB based on which layer of the\\nepidermis separates from the deeper dermis layer of the\\nskin below. Patients suspected of having EB should have a\\nfresh blister biopsied for review. This sample of tissue is\\nexamined under an electron microscope or under a con-\\nventional microscope using a technique called immunoflu-\\norescence, which helps to map the underlying structure.\\nKnowing that a family member has EB can help\\nestablish the diagnosis, but it is possible that parents or\\nsiblings will show no sign of the disease, either because\\nit is caused by a new genetic mutation, or because the\\nparents are carriers of the recessive trait and do not dis-\\nplay the disease.\\nTreatment\\nThe most important treatment for EB is daily wound\\ncare. Because the skin is very fragile, care must be taken\\nto be certain that dressing changes do not cause further\\ndamage.

These are both connected to the larynx, a\\ntube made of cartilage. The air continues down the larynx\\nto the trachea. The trachea then splits into two branches,\\nthe left and right bronchi (bronchial tubes). These bronchi\\nbranch into smaller air tubes that run within the lungs,\\nleading to the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli).\\nEither food, liquid, or air may be taken in through\\nthe mouth. While air goes into the larynx and the respira-\\ntory system, food and liquid are directed into the tube\\nleading to the stomach, the esophagus. Because food or\\nliquid in the bronchial tubes or lungs could cause a\\nblockage or lead to an infection, the airway is protected.\\nThe epiglottis is a leaf-like piece of cartilage extending\\nupwards from the larynx. The epiglottis can close down\\nover the larynx when someone is eating or drinking, pre-\\nventing these food and liquids from entering the airway.\\nEpiglottitis is an infection and inflammation of the\\nepiglottis. Because the epiglottis may swell considerably,\\nthere is a danger that the airway will be blocked off by\\nthe very structure designed to protect it. Air is then\\nunable to reach the lungs. Without intervention, epiglotti-\\ntis has the potential to be fatal.\\nEpiglottitis is primarily a disease of two to seven-\\nyear-old children, although older children and adults can\\nalso contract it. Boys are twice as likely as girls to devel-\\nop this infection. Because epiglottitis involves swelling\\nand infection of tissues, which are all located at or above\\nthe level of the epiglottis, it is sometimes referred to as\\nsupraglottitis (supra, meaning above). About 25% of all\\nchildren with this infection also have pneumonia.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of epiglottitis is infection\\nwith the bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b.\\nOther types of bacteria are also occasionally responsi-\\nble for this infection, including some types of Strepto-\\ncoccus bacteria and the bacteria responsible for causing\\ndiphtheria.\\nA patient with epiglottitis typically experiences a\\nsudden fever, and begins having severe throat and neck\\npain. Because the swollen epiglottis interferes signifi-\\ncantly with air movement, every breath creates a loud,\\nharsh, high-pitched sound referred to as stridor. Because\\nthe vocal cords are located in the larynx just below the\\narea of the epiglottis, the swollen epiglottis makes the\\npatient’s voice sound muffled and strained. Swallowing\\nbecomes difficult, and the patient may drool. The patient\\noften leans forward and juts out his or her jaw, while\\nstruggling for breath.\\nEpiglottitis strikes suddenly and progresses quickly.\\nA child may begin complaining of a sore throat , and\\nwithin a few hours be suffering from extremely severe\\nairway obstruction.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a high level of suspicion that\\na quickly progressing illness with fever, sore throat, and\\nairway obstruction is very likely to be epiglottitis. If\\nepiglottitis is suspected, no efforts should be made to\\nlook at the throat, or to swab the throat in order to obtain\\na culture for identification of the causative organism.\\nThese maneuvers may cause the larynx to go into spasm\\n(laryngospasm), completely closing the airway. These\\nprocedures should only be performed in a fully-equipped\\noperating room, so that if laryngospasm occurs, a breath-\\ning tube can be immediately placed in order to keep the\\nairway open.\\nAn instrument called a laryngoscope is often used in\\nthe operating room to view the epiglottis, which will\\nappear cherry-red and quite swollen. An x-ray picture\\ntaken from the side of the neck should also be obtained.\\nThe swollen epiglottis has a characteristic appearance,\\ncalled the “thumb sign.”\\nTreatment\\nTreatment almost always involves the immediate\\nestablishment of an artificial airway: inserting a breath-\\ning tube into the throat (intubation); or making a tiny\\nopening toward the base of the neck and putting a breath-\\ning tube into the trachea (tracheostomy).

In other cases, the\\nepisiotomy is performed by making a diagonal incision\\nacross the midline between the vagina and anus. This\\nmethod is used much less often, may be more painful,\\nand may require more healing time than the midline inci-\\nsion. After the baby is delivered through the extended\\nvaginal opening, the incision is closed with stitches. A\\nlocal anesthetic agent may be applied or injected to numb\\nthe area before it is sewn up (sutured).\\nSeveral reasons are cited for performing epi-\\nsiotomies. Some experts believe that an episiotomy\\nspeeds up the birthing process, making it easier for the\\nbaby to be delivered. This can be important if there is any\\nsign of distress that may harm the mother or baby.\\nBecause tissues in this area may tear during the delivery,\\nanother reason for performing an episiotomy is that a\\nclean incision is easier to repair than a jagged tear and\\nmay heal faster. Although the use of episiotomy is some-\\ntimes described as protecting the pelvic muscles and pos-\\nsibly preventing future problems with urinary inconti-\\nnence, it is not clear that the procedure actually helps.\\nThe use of episiotomy during the birthing process is\\nfairly widespread in the United States. Estimates of epi-\\nsiotomy use in hospitals range from 65–95% of deliver-\\nies, depending on how many times the mother has given\\nbirth previously. This routine use of episiotomy is being\\nreexamined in many hospitals and health care settings.\\nHowever, an episiotomy is always necessary during a\\nforceps delivery because of the size of the forceps.\\nPreparation\\nIt may be possible to avoid the need for an episioto-\\nmy. Pregnant women may want to talk with their care\\nproviders about the use of episiotomy during the deliv-\\nery. Kegel exercises are often recommended during the\\npregnancyto help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.\\nPrenatal perineal massage may help to stretch and relax\\nthe tissue around the vaginal opening. During the deliv-\\nery process, warm compresses can be applied to the area\\nalong with the use of perineal massage. Coaching and\\nsupport are also important during the delivery process. A\\nslowed, controlled pushing during the second stage of\\nlabor (when the mother gets the urge to push) may allow\\nthe tissues to stretch rather than tear. Also, an upright\\nbirthing position (rather than one where the mother is\\nlying down) may decrease the need for an episiotomy.\\nAftercare\\nThe area of the episiotomy may be uncomfortable or\\neven painful for several days. Several practices can\\nrelieve some of the pain. Cold packs can be applied to\\nthe perineal area to reduce swelling and discomfort. Use\\nof the Sitz bath available at the hospital or birth center\\ncan ease the discomfort, too. This unit circulates warm\\nwater over the area.

Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic-\\nular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the\\ndiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer\\nappears to be the case.\\nPrecautions\\nAs in any blood test, standard precautions should be\\nperformed to prevent infection at the site where the blood\\nis obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally,\\nthe site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the\\nblood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and\\nsyringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres-\\nsure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped.\\nDescription\\nThese tests are more often performed in a consulting\\nlaboratory than at a physician’s office or in a hospital\\nlaboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed\\non serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the\\nwhole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can\\nbe detected against several components of the Epstein-\\nBarr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early\\nantigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the\\nnuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif-\\nferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages)\\nof the virus’ growth.\\nAt the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,\\nantibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six\\nmonths only. This antibody, however, persists substan-\\ntially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV\\ninfection in the more remote past. The absence of anti-\\nbody to EA when other EBV antibodies are present\\nstrongly suggests that first time infection with EBV\\noccurred in the past.\\nAntibody to VCA is found both early and late in\\nEBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of\\nboth the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to\\nsix months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA\\ncan be found.\\nUnlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to\\nEBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first\\ntime infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable\\namounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which\\nmight be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship\\nvery unlikely.\\nPreparation\\nThe skin area from which the blood sample will be\\nobtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or\\niodine.\\nAftercare\\nThe aftercare is similar to that for any blood test.\\nUsually, pressure is applied to the area for several\\nmoments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult\\nto interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after\\nwaiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of\\nantibody detected between the two tests can be particu-\\nlarly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis.\\nRisks\\nThere are no risks over and above those of having\\nblood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more\\nexpensive than many other blood tests but are usually\\ncovered by medical insurance.\\nNormal results\\nThe pattern of the three antibodies can be used to\\ndetermine whether the person has not had infection with\\nEBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current-\\nly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or\\nhas had first time infection with EBV sometime in the\\npast (more than six months ago).\\nIf one defines “normal” results as either not having\\nEBV in the past, and call that category one; or having\\nhad it in the past, and call that category two. Most young\\nchildren below the age of five will fall into category one,\\nwhile most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into\\ncategory two.\\nThe results for susceptibility are:\\n• antibody to EA = negative\\n• antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative\\n• antibody to EBNA = Negative\\nThe results for past infection are:\\n• antibody to EA = negative (90% of time)\\n• antibody to VCA IgM = negative\\n• antibody to VCA IgG = positive\\n• antibody to EBNA = positive\\nIt is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus,\\nlike all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave\\nthe body after the patient recovers from illness.

The A, B, and O anti-\\ngens are used to classify a person’s blood as type A, B,\\nAB, or O. Each parent passes one A, B, or O antigen\\ngene to their child. How the genes are paired determines\\nthe person’s blood type.\\nA person who inherits an A antigen gene from each\\nparent has type A blood; receiving two B antigen genes\\ncorresponds with type B blood; and inheriting A and B\\nantigen genes means a person has type AB blood. If the\\nO antigen gene is inherited from both parents, the child\\nhas type O blood; however, the pairing of A and O anti-\\ngen genes corresponds with type A blood; and if the B\\nantigen gene is matched with the O antigen gene, the per-\\nson has type B blood.\\nAnother red blood cell antigen, called the Rh factor,\\nalso plays a role in describing a person’s blood type. A\\nperson with at least one copy of the gene for the Rh fac-\\ntor has Rh-positive blood; if no copies are inherited, the\\nperson’s blood type is Rh-negative. In blood typing, the\\npresence of A, B, and O antigens, plus the presence or\\nabsence of the Rh-factor, determine a person’s specific\\nblood type, such as A-positive, B-negative, and so on.\\nA person’s blood type has no effect on health. How-\\never, an individual’s immune system considers only that\\nperson’s specific blood type, or a close match, accept-\\nable. If a radically different blood type is introduced into\\nthe bloodstream, the immune system produces antibod-\\nies, proteins that specifically attack and destroy any cell\\ncarrying the foreign antigen.\\nDetermining a person’s blood type is very important\\nif she becomes pregnant. Blood cells from the unborn\\nbaby (fetal red blood cells) can cross over into the moth-\\ner’s bloodstream, especially at delivery. If the mother and\\nher baby have compatible blood types, the crossover\\ndoes not present any danger. However, if the blood types\\nare incompatible, the mother’s immune system manufac-\\ntures antibodies against the baby’s blood.\\nUsually, this incompatibility is not a factor in a first\\npregnancy , because few fetal blood cells reach the\\nmother’s bloodstream until delivery. The antibodies that\\nform after delivery cannot affect the first child. In later\\npregnancies, fetuses and babies may be in grave danger.\\nThe danger arises from the possibility that the mother’s\\nantibodies will attack the fetal red blood cells. If this\\nhappens, the fetus or baby can suffer severe health effects\\nand may die.\\nThere are two types of incompatibility diseases: Rh\\nincompatibility disease and ABO incompatibility disease.\\nBoth diseases have similar symptoms, but Rh disease is\\nmuch more severe, because anti-Rh antibodies cross over\\nthe placenta more readily than anti-A or anti-B antibod-\\nies. (The immune system does not form antibodies\\nagainst the O antigen.) Therefore, a greater percentage of\\nthe baby’s blood cells are destroyed by Rh disease.\\nBoth incompatibility diseases are uncommon in the\\nUnited States due to medical advances over the last 50\\nyears. For example, prior to 1946 (when newborn blood\\ntransfusions were introduced) 20,000 babies were affected\\nby Rh disease yearly. Further advances, such as suppress-\\ning the mother’s antibody response, have reduced the inci-\\ndence of Rh disease to approximately 4,000 cases per year.\\nRh disease only occurs if a mother is Rh-negative and\\nher baby is Rh-positive. For this situation to occur, the baby\\nmust inherit the Rh factor gene from the father. Most peo-\\nple are Rh-positive. Only 15% of the caucasian population\\nis Rh-negative, compared to 5–7% of the african american\\npopulation and virtually none of Asian populations.\\nABO incompatibility disease is almost always limit-\\ned to babies with A or B antigens whose mothers have\\ntype O blood. Approximately one third of these babies\\nshow evidence of the mother’s antibodies in their blood-\\nstream, but only a small percentage develop symptoms of\\nABO incompatibility disease.\\nCause and symptoms\\nRh disease and ABO incompatibility disease are\\ncaused when a mother’s immune system produces anti-\\nbodies against the red blood cells of her unborn child.\\nThe antibodies cause the baby’s red blood cells to be\\ndestroyed and the baby develops anemia. The baby’s\\nbody tries to compensate for the anemia by releasing\\nimmature red blood cells, called erythroblasts, from the\\nbone marrow.\\nThe overproduction of erythroblasts can cause the\\nliver and spleen to become enlarged, potentially causing\\nliver damage or a ruptured spleen. The emphasis on ery-\\nthroblast production is at the cost of producing other\\ntypes of blood cells, such as platelets and other factors\\nimportant for blood clotting. Since the blood lacks clot-\\nting factors, excessive bleeding can be a complication.\\nThe destroyed red blood cells release the blood’s\\nred pigment (hemoglobin) which degrades into a yellow\\nsubstance called bilirubin. Bilirubin is normally pro-\\nduced as red blood cells die, but the body is only\\nequipped to handle a certain low level of bilirubin in the\\nbloodstream at one time.

If the baby is in danger, and the\\npregnancy is at least 32–34 weeks along, labor is\\ninduced. Under 32 weeks, the baby is given blood trans-\\nfusions while still in the mother’s uterus.\\nThere are two techniques that are used to deliver a\\nblood transfusion to a baby before birth. In the first, a\\nneedle is inserted through the mother’s abdomen and\\nuterus, and into the baby’s abdomen. Red blood cells\\ninjected into the baby’s abdominal cavity are absorbed\\ninto its bloodstream.

These serious complications are life\\nthreatening, but with good medical treatment, the fatality\\nrate is very low.

A specific amount of diluted, unclotted\\nblood is placed in a special narrow tube and left undis-\\nturbed for exactly one hour. The red cells settle towards\\nthe bottom of the tube, and the pale yellow liquid (plas-\\nma) rises to the top. After 60 minutes, measurements are\\ntaken of the distance the red cells traveled to settle at the\\nbottom of the tube. Two methods, the Westergren and the\\nWintrobe, are used by laboratories; each method pro-\\nduces slightly different results. Most laboratories use the\\nWestergren method.\\nNormally red cells don’t settle far toward the bottom\\nof the tube. Many diseases make extra or abnormal pro-\\nteins that cause the red cells to move close together, stack\\nup, and form a column (rouleaux). In a group, red cells\\nare heavier and fall faster.

EPO is unique among the\\nblood cell growth factors, because it is the only one that\\nbehaves like a hormone.\\nErythropoietin acts as the principal regulator in the\\nproduction of red blood cells (erythrocytes) by control-\\nling the number, the kinds, and the survival of the cells.\\nBecause of this ability, it is being investigated for use in\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnemia—A condition in which the hemoglobin\\nconcentration in the blood is below normal.\\nPolycythemia vera—A condition characterized by\\nan unusually large number of red blood cells in\\nthe blood due to increased production by the\\nbone marrow.

Erythropoietin determination is also\\nvaluable in diagnosing a condition known as poly-\\ncythemia, when increased numbers of red blood cells\\noccur. Levels of erythropoietin are extremely low in\\npolycythemia verabut are normal or high in secondary\\npolycythemia. It happens rarely, but cysts in the liver or\\nkidneys, as well as tumors in the kidneys or brain, can\\nalso produce erythropoietin.

Some strains of E.\\ncoli are capable of causing disease under certain condi-\\ntions when the immune system is compromised or dis-\\nease may result from an environmental exposure.\\nDescription\\nE. colibacteria may give rise to infections in\\nwounds, the urinary tract, biliary tract, and abdominal\\ncavity ( peritonitis ). This organism may cause sep-\\nticemia, neonatal meningitis , infantile gastroenteritis ,\\ntourist diarrhea , and hemorrhagic diarrhea. An E. coli\\ninfection may also arise due to environmental exposure.\\nInfections with this type of bacteria pose a serious threat\\nto public health with outbreaks arising from food and\\nwater that has been contaminated with human or animal\\nfeces or sewage. This type of bacteria has been used as a\\nbiological indicator for safety of drinking water since the\\n1890s. Exposure may also occur during hospitalization,\\nresulting in pneumonia in immunocompromised\\npatients or those on a ventilator\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of infection and resulting complica-\\ntions are dependent upon the strain of E. coli and the site\\nof infection. These bacteria produce toxins that have a\\nwide range of effects. Symptoms caused by some E. coli\\ninfections range from mild to severe, bloody diarrhea,\\nacute abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Gastroin-\\ntestinal complications that can cause E. coli infections\\ninclude irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ischemic coli-\\ntis, appendicitis , perforation of the large bowel, and in\\nsome instances gangrene in the colon. Other known E.\\ncoli-causing infections may include chronic renal failure,\\npancreatitis, and diabetes mellitus . Some neurological\\nsymptoms such as drowsiness, seizure and coma may\\noccur. In infants, E. coli infections are present in cases of\\ninfantile gastroenteritis and neonatal meningitis.\\nStrains of E. coli that produce diarrhea were initially\\ndistinguished by their O (somatic) antigens found on the\\nbacterial surface. Although there is an overlap in charac-\\nteristics between strains, they may be classified into four\\nmain groups; enterohemorrahagic (0157),enteropatho-\\ngenic (055,0111), enterotoxigenic (06,078), and\\nenteroinvasive (0124,0164).\\nE.coli O157 (VTEC)\\nThe O157:H7 strain is the member of the group most\\noften associated with a particularly severe form of diar-\\nrhea. (The O indicates the somatic antigen, while the H\\ndenotes the flagellar antigen, both of which are found on\\nthe cell surface of the bacteria.) The bacterium was dis-\\ncovered in 1977, and first reports of infections followed in\\n1982. E. coli O157:H7, as it is frequently referred to by\\nresearchers, causes bloody diarrhea in many infected\\npatients. It accounts for about 2% of all cases of diarrhea\\nin the western world, and at least one-third of cases of\\nhemorrhagic colitis, or about 20,000 cases per year\\nE. coli O157:H7 is also the most common cause of\\nunique syndromes, known as the Hemolytic-Uremic\\nSyndrome (HUS) and thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),\\nwhich causes kidney failure, hemolytic anemia , and\\nthrombocytopenia. Usually, infection with this strain of\\nbacteria will subside without further complications.\\nHowever, about 5% of people who are infected will\\ndevelop HUS/TTP. This infection also accounts for the\\nmajority of episodes of HUS, especially in children.\\nThis strain of bacteria produces a potent toxin called\\nverotoxin, named for toxin’s ability to kill green monkey\\nkidney or “vero” cells. Bacteria that produce verotoxin\\nare referred to as Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC).\\nThe numbers of bacteria that are necessary to reproduce\\ninfectious levels of bacteria are quite small, estimated at\\n10-100 viable bacteria. These toxins are lethal for intesti-\\nnal cells and those that line vessels (endothelial cells),\\ninhibiting protein synthesis causing cell death. It is\\nbelieved that the damage to blood vessels results in the\\nformation of clots, which eventually leads to the\\nHemolytic-Uremic Syndrome. HUS/TTP is a serious,\\noften fatal, syndrome that has other causes in addition to\\nE. coliO157:H7; it is characterized by the breaking up of\\nred blood cells (hemolysis) and kidney failure (uremia).\\nThe syndrome occurs most often in the very young and\\nvery old.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1235\\nEscherichia coli'),\n",

Esophageal atresia occurs in\\napproximately 1 in 4,000 live births.\\nDescription\\nFailure of an unborn child (fetus) to develop proper-\\nly results in birth defects. Many of these defects involve\\norgans that do not function, or function only incidentally,\\nbefore birth, and, as a result, go undetected until the baby\\nis born. In this case, the digestive tract is unnecessary for\\nfetal growth, since all nutrition comes from the mother\\nthrough the placenta and umbilical cord.\\nDuring fetal development, the esophagus and the tra-\\nchea arise from the same original tissue. Normally, the\\ntwo tubes would form separately (differentiate); howev-\\ner, in cases of esphageal atresia and tracheoesophageal\\nfistulas, they do not, resulting in various malformed con-\\nfigurations. The most common configuration is the “C”\\ntype, in which the upper part of the esophagus abruptly\\nends in a blind pouch, while the lower part attaches itself\\nto the trachea. This configuration occurs in 85–90% of\\ncases. Esophageal atresia without involvement of the tra-\\nchea occurs in only 8% of cases.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of esophageal atresia, like that of most\\nbirth defects, is unknown.\\nAn infant born with this defect will at first appear all\\nright, swallowing normally. However, the blind pouch\\nwill begin to fill with mucus and saliva that would nor-\\nmally pass through the esophagus to the stomach. These\\nsecretions back up into the mouth and nasal area, causing\\nthe baby to drool excessively. When fed, the baby will\\nalso immediately regurgitate what he or she has eaten.\\nChokingand coughing may also occur as the baby\\nbreaths in the fluid backing up from the esophagus. Aspi-\\nration pneumonia, an infection of the respiratory system\\ncaused by inhalation of the contents of the digestive tract,\\nmay also develop.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians who suspect esophageal atresia after\\nbeing presented with the above symptoms diagnose the\\ncondition using x-ray imaging or by passing a catheter\\nthrough the nose and into the esophagus. Esophageal\\natresia is indicated if the catheter hits an obstruction 4–5\\nin (10–13 cm) from the nostrils.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1238\\nEsophageal atresia'),\n",

Since\\nmost patients are not diagnosed until the late stages of\\nthe disease, esophageal cancer is associated with poor\\nquality of life and low survival rates.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common type\\nof esophageal cancer, accounting for 95% of all\\nesophageal cancers worldwide. The esophagus is nor-\\nmally lined with thin, flat squamous cells that resemble\\ntiny roof shingles. Squamous cell carcinoma can develop\\nat any point along the esophagus but is most common in\\nthe middle portion.\\nAdenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carci-\\nnoma as the most common type of esophageal cancer in\\nthe United States. Adenocarcinoma originates in glandu-\\nlar tissue not normally present in the lining of the esoph-\\nagus. Before adenocarcinoma can develop, glandular\\ncells must replace a section of squamous cells. This\\noccurs in Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous condition\\nin which chronic acid reflux from the stomach stimulates\\na transformation in cell type in the lower portion of the\\nesophagus.\\nA very small fraction of esophageal cancers are\\nmelanomas, sarcomas, or lymphomas.\\nThere is great variability in the incidence of\\nesophageal cancer with regard to geography, ethnicity,\\nand gender. The overall incidence is increasing. About\\n13,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed in\\nthe United States each year. During the same 12-month\\nperiod, 12,000 people die of this disease. It strikes\\nbetween five and ten North Americans per 100,000. In\\nsome areas of China the cancer is endemic.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma usually occurs in the sixth\\nor seventh decade of life, with a greater incidence in\\nAfrican-Americans than in others. Adenocarcinoma\\ndevelops earlier and is much more common in white\\npatients. In general, esophageal cancer occurs more fre-\\nquently in men than in women.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown,\\nalthough many investigators believe that chronic irrita-\\ntion of the esophagus is a major culprit.

Patients with Barrett’s esophagus are roughly 30 to\\n40 times more likely than the general population to\\ndevelop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.\\n• A diet low in fruits, vegetables, zinc, riboflavin, and\\nother vitamins can increase risk of developing to\\nesophageal cancer.\\n• Caustic injury to the esophagus inflicted by swallowing\\nlye or other substances that damage esophageal cells can\\nlead to the development of squamous cell esophageal\\ncancer in later life.\\n• Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal\\nsphincter (muscle) cannot relax enough to let food pass\\ninto the stomach. Squamous cell esophageal cancer\\ndevelops in about 6% of patients with achalasia.\\n• Tylosis is a rare inherited disease characterized by\\nexcess skin on the palms and soles. Affected patients\\nhave a much higher probability of developing\\nesophageal cancer than the general population. They\\nshould have regular screenings to detect the disease in\\nits early, most curable stages.\\n• Esophageal webs, which are protrusions of tissue into\\nthe esophagus, and diverticula, which are outpouchings\\nof the wall of the esophagus, are associated with a high-\\ner incidence of esophageal cancer.\\nSymptoms\\nUnfortunately, symptoms generally don’t appear\\nuntil the tumor has grown so large that the patient cannot\\nbe cured. Dysphagia (trouble swallowing or a sensation\\nof having food stuck in the throat or chest) is the most\\ncommon symptom. Swallowing problems may occur\\noccasionally at first, and patients often react by eating\\nmore slowly and chewing their food more carefully and,\\nas the tumor grows, switching to soft foods or a liquid\\ndiet. Without treatment, the tumor will eventually pre-\\nvent even liquid from passing into the stomach. A sensa-\\ntion of burning or slight mid-chest pressure is a rare,\\noften-disregarded symptom of esophageal cancer.\\nPainful swallowing is usually a symptom of a large\\ntumor obstructing the opening of the esophagus. It can\\nlead to regurgitation of food, weight loss, physical wast-\\ning, and malnutrition . Anyone who has trouble swal-\\nlowing, loses a significant amount of weight without\\ndieting, or cannot eat solid food because it is too painful\\nto swallow should see a doctor.\\nDiagnosis\\nA barium swallow is usually the first test performed\\non a patient whose symptoms suggest esophageal cancer.\\nAfter the patient swallows a small amount of barium, a\\nseries of x rays can highlight any bumps or flat raised\\nareas on the normally smooth surface of the esophageal\\nwall. It can also detect large, irregular areas that narrow\\nthe esophagus in patients with advanced cancer, but it can-\\nnot provide information about disease that has spread\\nbeyond the esophagus. A double contrast study is a barium\\nswallow with air blown into the esophagus to improve the\\nway the barium coats the esophageal lining. Endoscopy is\\na diagnostic procedure in which a thin lighted tube (endo-\\nscope) is passed through the mouth, down the throat, and\\ninto the esophagus. Cells that appear abnormal are\\nremoved for biopsy. Once a diagnosis of esophageal can-\\ncer has been confirmed through biopsy, staging tests are\\nperformed to determine whether the disease has spread\\n(metastasized) to tissues or organs near the original tumor\\nor in other parts of the body. These tests may include com-\\nputed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound,thoracoscopy,\\nlaparoscopy, and positron emission tomography.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for esophageal cancer is determined by the\\nstage of the disease and the patient’s general health. The\\nmost important distinction to make is whether the cancer\\nis curable. If the cancer is in the early stages, cure may be\\npossible. If the cancer is advanced or if the patient will\\nnot tolerate major surgery, treatment is usually directed at\\npalliation (relief of symptoms only) instead of cure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1240\\nEsophageal cancer'),\n",

The main function of this organ is to propel\\nfood down into the stomach. There is also a mechanism\\nto prevent food from coming back up or “refluxing” from\\nthe stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal function\\ntests are used to determine if these processes are normal\\nor abnormal.\\nPurpose\\nThe esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has\\ntwo muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All of\\nthese muscular areas must contract in an exact sequence\\nfor swallowing to proceed normally. There are three\\nmain symptoms that occur when esophageal function is\\nabnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia),heart-\\nburn, and chest pain.\\nDoctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these\\nsymptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophageal\\nfunction, is often used to determine if the lining of the\\nesophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing\\n(strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only shows\\nthe doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, and\\nthe procedure gives no information about the cause of the\\nproblem.\\nTherefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies\\nare available that measure esophageal function. There are\\nthree basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func-\\ntion:\\n• Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of the\\nesophagus contract, and is most useful for the investi-\\ngation of difficulty with swallowing.\\n• Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in\\nesophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluating\\npatients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-\\nease (GERD).\\n• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They\\neither follow the progress of barium during swallowing\\nusing a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanning\\ntechniques.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21242\\nEsophageal function tests'),\n",

An abnormality in the function of\\nany one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes\\ndifficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys-\\nphagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those\\npatients whose endoscopy is negative.\\nDuring manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube\\ncarrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the\\nesophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal-\\nlowing. Medications are sometimes given during the\\nstudy to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans-\\nmitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best\\nidentify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or\\ncontractions of the esophagus.\\nEsophageal pH monitoring\\nThis procedure involves measuring the esophagus’\\nexposure to acid that has “refluxed” from the stomach.\\nThe test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or\\nGERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but\\nalso ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing\\n(strictures) when they heal.\\nNormally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only\\nsmall amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called\\nthe lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux.\\nSpontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp-\\ntying and production of saliva are other important protec-\\ntive mechanisms.\\n“pH” is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or\\nalkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the\\nesophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per-\\nsists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been\\ndesigned to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu-\\nally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily\\nroutine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in\\ntheir activities they occurred. During this period, a thin\\ntube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record\\nchanges. After the study, a computer is used to compare\\nchanges in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient.\\nSurgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for\\nsymptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many\\npatients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed\\nbefore surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the\\neffects of drug therapy.\\nX-ray tests\\nThese fall into two categories: (1) those done with\\nthe use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per-\\nformed with radioactive materials.\\nStudies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest\\nvalue in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph-\\nagus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function\\ntest, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic\\npossibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated\\nwith barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction.\\nDuring fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the\\npassage of material through the esophagus in real time,\\nand video recordings can also be done. This is particularly\\nuseful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve\\nmainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com-\\nmon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke,\\nalthough other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like\\nmyasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms.\\nScans using low-dose radioactive materials are use-\\nful because they are able not only to demonstrate that\\nfood passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor-\\nmal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow-\\ning food coated with material that is followed by a\\nnuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when\\nother methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is\\nnecessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As\\nof 1997, scans mainly served as research tools.\\nPreparation\\nPatients should not eat or drink for several hours\\nbefore the exam. Many medications affect the esopha-\\ngus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even\\nstopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of all\\nmedications taken, including over-the-counter medica-\\ntions (purchased without a doctor’s prescription), and\\nany known allergies.\\nAftercare\\nFor most of these studies, no special care is needed\\nafter the procedure. Patients can often go about normal\\ndaily activities following any of these tests. One excep-\\ntion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the use\\nof barium. This can have a constipating effect and\\npatients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.\\nRisks\\nExposure of a fetus to x rays, especially in the first\\nthree months, is a potential risk.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1243\\nEsophageal function tests'),\n",

A defect in the wall of the esophagus\\nmay allow the lining to herniate, creating a space where\\nfood can be caught. Pouches can appear anywhere\\nbetween the throat and the stomach. They occur primari-\\nly in men and usually later in life.\\nDifferent names for the condition apply to different\\nlocations along the esophagus:\\n• Zenker’s diverticula are pharyngeal pouches, or ones\\nthat occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph-\\nagus.\\n• Traction diverticula are a type of mid-esophageal\\npouch.\\n• Epiphrenic diverticula occur at the bottom of the esoph-\\nagus near where it enters the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTo propel food into the stomach (or out of it during\\nvomiting) the esophagus generates internal pressure just\\nlike the bowel. Under certain circumstances, that pressure\\ncan herniate the esophageal lining through a weakness in\\nthe wall, creating a pouch (a balloon squeezed in the hand\\nwill herniate through the fingers in the same way). Pouch-\\nes are more common in people who have motility disor-\\nders of the esophagus, swallowing that is not well coordi-\\nnated and may be spastic. A traction diverticulum can\\ndevelop from a scar that pulls the esophagus out of shape.\\nFood and saliva can collect in all of these pouches.\\nPouches in the neck usually cause bad breath (hali-\\ntosis) and the regurgitation of swallowed food and saliva.\\nSome patients with Zenker’s diverticula can push on their\\nneck and make old food appear in their mouths. Pouches\\nnear the stomach may cause swallowing problems, condi-\\ntions known as achalasia or dysphagia. Mid-esophageal\\npouches usually cause no symptoms.\\nIn the most serious cases, a person may be unable to\\nswallow because the esophagus is obstructed, or the\\nesphagus may rupture, spilling its contents into the chest\\nor neck.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21244\\nEsophageal pouches'),\n",

When the\\nprocedure is limited to the examination of the inside of\\nthe gastrointestinal tract’s upper portion, it is called\\nupper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).\\nWith the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube),\\nstomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes-\\ntine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent-\\nly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam.\\nPurpose\\nEGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms\\nrelating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as:\\n• upper abdominal or chest pain\\n• nausea or vomiting\\n• difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\\n• bleeding from the upper intestinal tract\\n• anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat\\ncertain conditions, such as an area of narrowing or\\nbleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract\\nUpper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for\\ndetecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used to\\ndiagnose early cancer and can frequently determine\\nwhether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant\\n(cancerous).\\nBiopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or “sus-\\npicious” areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol-\\nogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc-\\ntion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of cancer\\nor infections.\\nWhen treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo-\\nscope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), or\\nremove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). In\\naddition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treated\\nby a number of endoscopic techniques.\\nRecent studies have shown the usefulness of endo-\\nscopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom-\\nach.

These sig-\\nnals can be recorded by wires placed over the nerves on\\nthe surface of the skin, in a procedure called an evoked\\npotential (EP) study. The person conducting the test\\nevokes the patient’s neural activity by visual or auditory\\nstimulation or using a mild electrical shock. This causes\\nchanges in the electrical potential in the nerves. Analysis\\nof the signals can provide information about the condi-\\ntion of nerve pathways, especially those in the brain and\\nspinal cord. They can indicate the presence of disease or\\ndegeneration, and can help determine the location of\\nnerve lesions.\\nThere are three major types of EP studies used regu-\\nlarly:\\n• Visual evoked potentials are used to diagnose visual\\nlosses due to optic nerve damage, especially from mul-\\ntiple sclerosis . They are also useful to diagnose “hys-\\nterical blindness,” in which loss of vision is not due to\\nany nerve damage.\\n• Auditory evoked potentials are used to diagnose hearing\\nlosses. They can distinguish damage to the acoustic nerve\\n(which carries signals from the ear to the brain stem)\\nfrom damage to the auditory pathways within the brain-\\nstem. Most auditory EPs record activity from the brain-\\nstem, and are therefore called “brainstem auditory evoked\\npotentials.” Disorders diagnosed with auditory EPs\\ninclude acoustic neuroma (tumors of the inner ear) and\\nmultiple sclerosis (chronic disease in which nerves lose\\npatches of their outer covering). They may also be used to\\nassess high frequency hearing ability, to determine brain\\ndeath, and to monitor brainstem function during surgery\\n• Somatosensory evoked potentials record transmission of\\nnerve impulses from the limbs to the brain, and can be\\nused to diagnose nerve damage or degeneration within\\nthe spinal cord or nerve roots from multiple sclerosis,\\ntrauma, or other degenerative disease. Somatosensory\\nEPs can be used to distinguish central versus peripheral\\nnerve disease, when combined with results from a nerve\\nconduction velocity test, which measures nerve function\\nin the extremities.\\nPrecautions\\nEvoked potential studies are painless, noninvasive,\\nand without any significant risk. Somatosensory EP tests\\ninvolve very mild electric shocks, usually felt as a tingling.\\nDescription\\nThe person performing the test locates and marks\\nspecific spots on the patient’s head for placement of elec-\\ntrodes. These spots are cleaned, and an adhesive conduct-\\ning paste is applied. Cup electrodes are attached. For\\nsomatosensory EP, spots on the arm or leg are also\\nmarked and cleaned; electrodes may be taped in place.\\nThe patient sits or reclines in a chair throughout the tests.\\nFor a visual EP, the patient focuses on a TV screen\\nwhich displays a checkerboard pattern. The eye not being\\ntested is covered with a patch. For children or others\\nwhose attention may wander, goggles are used which\\nshow the pattern to one eye at a time. Each eye is usually\\ntested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-\\nly 30–45 minutes.\\nFor auditory EP, headphones are used to deliver a\\nseries of clicks to one ear at a time. A masking or static\\nsound is played into the other ear. Each ear is usually\\ntested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-\\nly 30–45 minutes.\\nFor somatosensory EP, mild electrical shocks are\\ndelivered to the arm or leg. This may cause some twitch-\\ning and tingling. The stimulus lasts for about two min-\\nutes at a time, and the entire procedure takes approxi-\\nmately 30 minutes.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1248\\nEvoked potential studies'),\n",

Range of motion is one aspect of exercise\\nimportant for increasing or maintaining joint function.\\nStrengthening exercises provide appropriate resistance to\\nthe muscles to increase endurance and strength. Cardiac\\nrehabilitation exercises are developed and individualized\\nto improve the cardiovascular system for prevention and\\nrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and diseases. A well-\\nbalanced exercise program can improve general health,\\nbuild endurance, and delay many of the effects of aging.\\nThe benefits of exercise not only improve physical health,\\nbut also enhance emotional well-being.\\nPrecautions\\nBefore beginning any exercise program, an evalua-\\ntion by a physician is recommended to rule out any poten-\\ntial health risks. Once health and fitness are determined,\\nand any or all physical restrictions identified, an individ-\\nual’s exercise program should be under the supervision of\\na health care professional. This is especially the case\\nwhen exercise is used as a form of rehabilitation. If symp-\\ntoms of dizziness, nausea, excessive shortness of breath,\\nor chest pain are present during any exercise program, an\\nindividual should stop the activity and inform a physician\\nabout these symptoms before resuming activity.

Passive range of motion is\\nmovement applied to a joint solely by another person or\\npersons or a passive motion machine. When passive\\nrange of motion is applied, the joint of an individual\\nreceiving exercise is completely relaxed while the out-\\nside force moves the body part, such as a leg or arm,\\nthroughout the available range. Injury, surgery, or immo-\\nbilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of\\nmotion. Active range of motion is movement of a joint\\nprovided entirely by the individual performing the exer-\\ncise. In this case, there is no outside force aiding in the\\nmovement. Active assist range of motion is described as\\na joint receiving partial assistance from an outside force.\\nThis range of motion may result from the majority of\\nmotion applied by an exerciser or by the person or per-\\nsons assisting the individual. It may also be a half-and-\\nhalf effort on the joint from each source.\\nStrengthening exercise\\nStrengthening exercise increases muscle strength\\nand mass, bone strength, and the body’s metabolism. It\\ncan help attain and maintain proper weight and improve\\nbody image and self-esteem. A certain level of muscle\\nstrength is needed to do daily activities, such as walking,\\nrunning and climbing stairs. Strengthening exercises\\nincrease this muscle strength by putting more strain on a\\nmuscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving. This\\nincreased load stimulates the growth of proteins inside\\neach muscle cell that allow the muscle as a whole to con-\\ntract. There is evidence indicating that strength training\\nmay be better than aerobic exercise alone for improving\\nself-esteem and body image. Weight training allows one\\nimmediate feedback, through observation of progress in\\nmuscle growth and improved muscle tone. Strengthening\\nexercise can take the form of isometric, isotonic and iso-\\nkinetic strengthening.\\nISOMETRIC EXERCISE. During isometric exercises,\\nmuscles contract. However, there is no motion in the\\naffected joints. The muscle fibers maintain a constant\\nlength throughout the entire contraction. The exercises\\nare usually performed against an immovable surface or\\nobject such as pressing one’s hand against a wall. The\\nmuscles of the arm are contracting but the wall is not\\nreacting or moving as a result of the physical effort. Iso-\\nmetric training is effective for developing total strength\\nof a particular muscle or group of muscles. It is often\\nused for rehabilitation since the exact area of muscle\\nweakness can be isolated and strengthening can be\\nadministered at the proper joint angle. This kind of train-\\ning can provide a relatively quick and convenient method\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1250\\nExercise\\nTHREE TYPES OF EXERCISE\\nStretching, for flexibility Weight-bearing, for \\nstrengthening muscles\\n and bone mass\\nAerobic, for the heart\\nExercise is utilized to improve health, maintain fitness, and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation.(Illustration by\\nElectronic Illustrators Group.)'),\n",

Isotonic exercise differs from\\nisometric exercise in that there is movement of a joint\\nduring the muscle contraction. A classic example of an\\nisotonic exercise is weight training with dumbbells and\\nbarbells. As the weight is lifted throughout the range of\\nmotion, the muscle shortens and lengthens. Calisthenics\\nare also an example of isotonic exercise. These would\\ninclude chin-ups, push-ups, and sit-ups, all of which use\\nbody weight as the resistance force.\\nISOKINETIC EXERCISE. Isokinetic exercise utilizes\\nmachines that control the speed of contraction within the\\nrange of motion. Isokinetic exercise attempts to combine\\nthe best features of both isometrics and weight training.\\nIt provides muscular overload at a constant preset speed\\nwhile a muscle mobilizes its force through the full range\\nof motion. For example, an isokinetic stationary bicycle\\nset at 90 revolutions per minute means that despite how\\nhard and fast the exerciser works, the isokinetic proper-\\nties of the bicycle will allow the exerciser to pedal only\\nas fast as 90 revolutions per minute. Machines known as\\nCybex and Biodex provide isokinetic results; they are\\ngenerally used by physical therapists and are not readily\\navailable to the general population.\\nCardiac rehabilitation\\nExercise can be very helpful in prevention and\\nrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and disease. With an\\nindividually designed exercise program set at a level\\nconsidered safe for that individual, people with symp-\\ntoms of heart failure can substantially improve their\\nfitness levels. The greatest benefit occurs as muscles\\nimprove the efficiency of their oxygen use, which\\nreduces the need for the heart to pump as much blood.\\nWhile such exercise doesn’t appear to improve the con-\\ndition of the heart itself, the increased fitness level\\nreduces the total workload of the heart. The related\\nincrease in endurance should also translate into a gener-\\nally more active lifestyle. Endurance or aerobic rou-\\ntines, such as running, brisk walking, cycling, or swim-\\nming, increase the strength and efficiency of the mus-\\ncles of the heart.\\nPreparation\\nA physical examination by a physician is important\\nto determine if strenuous exercise is appropriate or detri-\\nmental for an individual. Prior to the exercise program,\\nproper stretching is important to prevent the possibility\\nof soft tissue injury resulting from tight muscles, ten-\\ndons, ligaments, and other joint-related structures.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAerobic—Exercise training that is geared to pro-\\nvide a sufficient cardiovascular overload to stimu-\\nlate increases in cardiac output.\\nCalisthenics—Exercise involving free movement\\nwithout the aid of equipment.\\nEndurance—The time limit of a person’s ability to\\nmaintain either a specific force or power involving\\nmuscular contractions.\\nOsteoporosis—A disorder characterized by loss of\\ncalcium in the bone, leading to thinning of the\\nbones. It occurs frequently in postmenopausal\\nwomen.\\nAftercare\\nProper cool down after exercise is important in\\nreducing the occurrence of painful muscle spasms. It has\\nbeen documented that proper cool down may also\\ndecrease frequency and intensity of muscle stiffness the\\nday following any exercise program.\\nRisks\\nImproper warm up can lead to muscle strains.\\nOverexertion with not enough time between exercise ses-\\nsions to recuperate can also lead to muscle strains, result-\\ning in inactivity due to pain. Stress fractures are also a\\npossibility if activities are strenuous over long periods of\\ntime without proper rest. Although exercise is safe for the\\nmajority of children and adults, there is still a need for\\nfurther studies to identify potential risks.\\nNormal results\\nSignificant health benefits are obtained by including a\\nmoderate amount of physical exercise in the form of an\\nexercise prescription. This is much like a drug prescription\\nin that it also helps enhance the health of those who take it\\nin the proper dosage.

The terms exophthalmos and proptosis apply. Prop-\\ntosis can refer to any organ that is displaced forward,\\nwhile exophthalmos refers just to the eyes.\\nDescription\\nThe eye socket (orbit) is made of bone and therefore\\nwill not yield to increased pressure within it. Only for-\\nward displacement of the eyeball (globe) will allow more\\nroom if tissue behind the eye is increasing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of exophthalmos is\\nGraves’ disease, overactivity of the thyroid gland. The\\ncontents of the orbits swell due to inflammation, forcing\\nthe eyes forward. The inflammation affects primarily the\\nmuscles. This combination of muscle impairment and\\nforward displacement reduces eye movement, causing\\ndouble vision and crossed eyes (strabismus). The optic\\nnerves can also be affected, reducing vision, and the\\nclear membrane (conjunctiva) covering the white part of\\nthe eyes and lining the inside of the eyelids can swell.\\nFinally, the eyes may protrude so far that the eyelids can-\\nnot close over them, leading to corneal damage.\\nExophthalmos from Graves’ disease is bilateral\\n(occurring on both sides), but not necessarily symmetri-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21252\\nExophthalmos'),\n",

In contrast, exophthalmos from orbital tumors or a\\nblood clot in the brain happens on only one side.\\nDiagnosis\\nExophthalmos is obvious when it is advanced\\nenough to cause complications. When there is doubt in\\nthe early stages, a mechanical device called an exoph-\\nthalmometer can measure the protrusion. Computed\\ntomography scans (CT scans) are of great value in\\nexamining the bony components of the orbit. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) scanning is equally valuable\\nfor displaying the contents of the orbit, because it “sees\\nthrough” the bone.\\nTreatment\\nIf a tumor is growing behind the eye, it needs to be\\nremoved. If Graves’ disease is the cause, it may subside\\nwith treatment of the overactive thyroid, but this is not\\nguaranteed. Local care to the front of the eye to keep it\\nmoist is necessary if the eyelid cannot close.\\nPrognosis\\nExophthalmos can be progressive. Its progress must\\nbe carefully followed, treating complications as they\\noccur.\\nPrevention\\nVision can usually be preserved with attentive treat-\\nment.

When a\\npatient cannot voluntarily control urination (inconti-\\nnence), a physician may order this test to determine if the\\nproblem is caused by the failure of this muscle. The vol-\\nuntary contraction or release of a muscle such as the\\nexternal sphincter involves a complex process in which\\nthe nerves controlling the muscle signal it to move\\nthrough the release and uptake of chemicals called neu-\\nrotransmitters and the generation of electrical impulses.\\nThis test records the electrical impulses given off when\\nthe muscle contracts or relaxes and allows the physician\\nto determine if the muscle is working properly, if it has\\nbeen damaged by disease, or some other condition.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients who are taking muscle relaxants or drugs\\nthat act like or have an effect on the neurotransmitter\\nacetylcholine (cholinergic or anti-cholinergic drugs)\\nshould tell the doctor since they will change the test\\nresults. The results will also be altered if the patient moves\\nduring the test or if the electrodes are improperly placed.\\nDescription\\nThe patient puts on a surgical gown and lies down on\\nthe examining table. The procedure, which takes between\\n30–60 minutes, may be conducted one of three ways:\\n• Skin electrodes. This is the most commonly used method\\nof recording information. The skin where the electrodes\\nwill be placed is cleaned and shaved and an electrically\\nconductive paste is applied. The electrodes are then taped\\nin place. For female patients, the electrodes are taped\\naround the urethra, while for male patients they are\\nplaced between the scrotum and the anus.\\n• Needle electrodes. This is considered the most accurate\\nmethod, since the electrodes are inserted directly into\\nthe muscle, using needles to guide placement. For male\\npatients, a gloved finger is inserted in the rectum, then\\nneedles with wires attached are inserted through the\\nskin between the anus and the scrotum. For female\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnti-cholinergic drug —A medication that blocks\\nor subdues the action of the neurotransmitter\\nacetylcholine.\\nCholinergic drug—A medication that mimics or\\nenhances the action of the neurotransmitter\\nacetylcholine.\\nSphincter—A circular muscle that aids in the\\nopening or closing of an opening in the body.\\npatients, the needles are inserted around the urethra.\\nThe discomfort of placing the needles is about the same\\nas that of an injection. The needles are withdrawn, and\\nthe wires are taped to the thigh.\\n• Anal plug electrodes. The tip of an anal plug is lubricat-\\ned and inserted into the rectum as the patient relaxes the\\nanal sphincter. Electrodes are attached to the anal plug.\\nOnce the electrodes are in place and attached to the\\nrecording device, the patient is asked to alternately con-\\ntract and relax the external sphincter muscle. The electri-\\ncal activity generated during these contractions and relax-\\nations is recorded on a graph called an electromyogram.\\nPreparation\\nBefore the test, the patient should discuss with the\\ndoctor whether it is necessary to temporarily discontinue\\nany medications, and follow the doctor’s orders. No\\nchanges in diet or activity are necessary.\\nAftercare\\nWomen may see some blood in their urine the first time\\nthey urinate after the test. Blood in the urine of men or blood\\nin the urine of women after the first urination should be\\nreported the doctor.

ECMO is used most often in new-\\nborns and young children, but it also can be used as a last\\nresort for adults whose heart or lungs are failing.\\nPurpose\\nIn newborns, ECMO is used to support or replace an\\ninfant’s undeveloped or failing lungs by providing oxy-\\ngen and removing carbon dioxide waste products so the\\nlungs can rest. Infants who need ECMO may include\\nthose with:\\n• meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in of a new-\\nborn’s first stool by a fetus or newborn, which can\\nblock air passages and interfere with lung expansion)\\n• persistent pulmonary hypertension (a disorder in\\nwhich the blood pressure in the arteries supplying the\\nlungs is abnormally high)\\n• respiratory distress syndrome (a lung disorder usually\\nof premature infants that causes increasing difficulty in\\nbreathing, leading to a life-threatening deficiency of\\noxygen in the blood)\\n• congenital diaphragmatic hernia (the profusion of part\\nof the stomach through an opening in the diaphragm).\\n• pneumonia\\n• blood poisoning\\nECMO is also used to support a child or adult\\npatient’s damaged, infected, or failing lungs for a few\\nhours to allow treatment or healing. It is effective for\\nthose patients with severe, but reversible, heart or lung\\nproblems who haven’t responded to treatment with a\\nventilator, drugs, or extra oxygen. Adults and children\\nwho need ECMO usually have one of these problems:\\n• heart failure\\n• pneumonia\\n•respiratory failure caused by trauma or severe infec-\\ntion\\nThe ECMO procedure can help a patient’s lungs and\\nheart rest and recover, but it will not cure the underlying\\ndisease. Any patient who requires ECMO is seriously ill\\nand will likely die without the treatment. Because there\\nis some risk involved, this method is used only when\\nother means of support have failed.\\nPrecautions\\nTypically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays\\nand blood work, and constant vital sign monitoring. They\\nare usually placed on a special rotating bed that is\\ndesigned to decrease pressure on the skin and help move\\nsecretions from the lungs.\\nAfter the patient is stable on ECMO, the breathing\\nmachine settings will be lowered to “rest” settings, which\\nallows the lungs to rest without the risk of too much oxy-\\ngen or pressure from the ventilator.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of ECMO: Venoarterial (V-A)\\nECMO supports the heart and lungs, and is used for\\npatients with blood pressure or heart functioning prob-\\nlems in addition to respiratory problems. Venovenous (V-\\nV) ECMO supports the lungs only.\\nV-A ECMO requires the insertion of two tubes, one\\nin the jugular and one in the carotid artery. In the V-V\\nECMO procedure, the surgeon places a plastic tube into\\nthe jugular vein through a small incision in the neck.\\nOnce in place, the tubes are connected to the ECMO\\ncircuit, and then the machine is turned on. The patient’s\\nblood flows out through the tube and may look very dark\\nbecause it contains very little oxygen.

Ultrasound is used to detect and diag-\\nnose many eye diseases and injuries, to measure the\\neye prior to corrective surgery, and directly as a treat-\\nment tool.\\nPurpose\\nAn ophthalmologist uses ultrasonic imaging to help\\ndiagnose the underlying cause(s) of a patient’s symp-\\ntoms, to assess the general condition of an injured eye,\\nand to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery. Situa-\\ntions that may call for ultrasonic imaging include:\\n• Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external\\nsymptoms could indicate a serious underlying problem\\nsuch as a tumor, an internal infection, the presence of a\\ndeeply lodged irritant (foreign body), or the effects of a\\npreviously unrecognized injury. When presented with\\ngeneral symptoms, ultrasound can speed diagnosis if a\\nserious condition is suspected.\\n• Impaired vision. Fuzzy vision, poor night vision,\\nrestricted (tunnel) vision, blind spots, extreme light\\nsensitivity, and even blindness can all stem from inner\\neye conditions ranging from glaucoma and cataracts,\\nto retinitis, detached retina, tumors, or impaired blood\\ncirculation. Again, high resolution ultrasound can\\nquickly identify causes and pinpoint their location. A\\nspecial type of ultrasound, known as Doppler, can even\\nperceive and measure circulation in the tiny blood ves-\\nsels of the eye.\\n• Eye trauma. The eye can be damaged by a direct impact\\nor a puncture wound, as a result of a general head trau-\\nma, or by intense light exposure. Even when the cause\\nof injury is obvious, ultrasound can reveal the exact\\ntype, extent, and location of damage, from deforma-\\ntions and ruptures to internal bleeding, and help to\\nguide emergency care efforts.\\n• Lens replacement surgery. Exact measurement of the\\neye’s optical dimensions with ultrasound greatly\\nimproves the visual outcome for cataract patients\\nreceiving permanent synthetic lenses; and for severely\\nmyopic patients receiving implanted corrective lenses.\\nOphthalmic ultrasound imaging is also used routine-\\nly to guide the precise placement of instruments during\\nsurgery, and can be used directly for the treatment of\\nglaucoma and tumors of the eye.\\nPrecautions\\nUltrasound of the eye, properly performed by quali-\\nfied personnel using appropriate equipment, has no risks.\\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the procedure itself\\nposes any threat to a healthy eye, or worsens the condi-\\ntion of a diseased or injured eye.\\nDescription\\nOphthalmic ultrasound equipment sends high fre-\\nquency pulses of sound into the eye, where they bounce\\noff the boundaries between different structures in the eye\\nand produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. This echo\\npattern is received and interpreted by a computer to pro-\\nduce an image on a television screen.

Doppler mode\\nultrasound combines B-mode with the ability to detect\\nand measure the flow of blood in the tiny vessels of\\nthe eye.\\nAs a direct treatment tool, the vibrations of high\\nintensity A-mode ultrasound can be used to heat and\\nerode tumors. The same technique can be used to con-\\ntrol glaucoma by selectively destroying the cells which\\nproduce the fluid that causes the internal pressure of the\\neye to rise.\\nThe procedure followed in a regular ultrasonic eye\\nexamination is relatively simple. The patient relaxes in\\na comfortable chair in a darkened room. Mild anesthetic\\neye drops are administered and the head is held secure.\\nThe ultrasonic probe, coated with a sterile gel to ensure\\ngood contact, is lightly pressed against the eye as the\\nimages are made.

The patient feels\\nnothing else, and the whole office procedure takes about\\n15 minutes.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation by the patient is generally unnecessary,\\nalthough under special circumstances an ophthalmologist\\nmay perform pretest procedures.

Because of this there are sever-\\nal types of ocular cancer. Their occurrence varies in the\\nage of the affected individual. This article will focus on\\nretinoblastoma, the most common eye cancer in chil-\\ndren, and intraocular melanoma, the most common eye\\ncancer in adults.\\nRetinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most\\noften seen in children younger than five. About 200 chil-\\ndren a year are diagnosed with it in the United States.\\nRetinoblastoma starts with a small tumor in the retina,\\nthe very back of the eye. In growing children, the retina\\noriginates from cells called retinoblasts that grow and\\ndivide very quickly. These cells eventually become the\\nmature cells of the retina when they stop growing. In the\\ncase of retinoblastoma the retinoblasts don’t stop grow-\\ning and form a tumor that can continue to grow and cause\\nfurther complications if not treated quickly.\\nRetinoblastoma typically has three classifications:\\nintraocular, extraocular and recurrent retinoblastoma. In\\nthe intraocular form the cancer can be found in one or\\nboth eyes but not in tissue external of the eye. In the\\nextraocular form the cancer has spread outside the eye. It\\ncan spread to the tissue surrounding the eye or it can\\ninvade other areas of the body. In the recurrent form the\\ncancer returns after already being treated. It may recur in\\nthe eye, its surrounding tissues, or elsewhere in the body.\\nIntraocular melanoma is a rare cancer overall, yet it\\nis the most common eye cancer seen in adults. It is when\\ncancer cells are found in the uvea of the eye. The uvea\\nincludes the iris (the colored portion of eye), the ciliary\\nbody (an eye muscle that focuses the lens) and the\\nchoroid (found in the back of the eye next to the retina).\\nIntraocular cancer of the iris usually grows slowly\\nand usually doesn’t spread. The tumor is seen on the iris\\nas a darker spot than the surrounding area. Intraocular\\ncancer of the choroid or ciliary body occurs in the back\\nof the eye. They are classified by size with a small tumor\\nbeing 2-3 mm or smaller and a medium or large tumor\\nbeing bigger than 3 mm.\\nIntraocular cancer can spread and become extraocu-\\nlar as well. If not found and treated early enough it can\\nspread to the surrounding tissues, the optic nerve or into\\nthe eye socket.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nGenetics is thought to play a role in eye cancer. In\\nregards to retinoblastoma, it is believed that if a tumor\\ndevelops only in one eye then it isn’t hereditary. Howev-\\ner, if a tumor occurs in both eyes then it is hereditary.\\nThose who have hereditary retinoblastoma have a rare\\nrisk of developing a tumor in the brain and should be\\nmonitored on a regular basis.\\nThe cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague.\\nGenetics could play a role, but age is also a factor. Inter-\\nestingly enough, this type of cancer is seen most often in\\nwhite people from a northern European descent.\\nThe symptoms of this type of cancer usually begin\\nwith blurred vision and tenderness of the eye. Advanced\\nsymptoms may include loss of vision. If these symptoms\\npersist a person should make an appointment with their\\nophthalmologist.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn ophthalmologist makes a diagnosis. The doctor\\nis usually able to see the tumor through the pupil or\\ndirectly on the iris if the cancer is intraocular melanoma\\nof the iris. Because the doctor can usually readily see the\\ntumor a biopsy is rarely needed.\\nAn ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two\\ntests doctors use to further diagnose eye cancers. In an\\nultrasound sound waves are pointed at the tumor and\\ndepending on how they reflect off the tumor the doctor\\ncan better diagnose it. In a fluorescein angiography a flu-\\norescent dye is injected into the patients arm. When this\\ndye circulates through the body and reaches the eye a\\nseries of rapid pictures are taken through the pupil. The\\ntumor will show up in these photos.\\nOnce a diagnosis has been made, the treatment can\\nbegin.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment depends on how far advanced the\\ntumor is.

If the tumor isn’t advanced these are good\\noptions to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye.\\nA radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is\\nbrachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine on\\none side and gold on the other is stitched to the eye\\nbehind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing the\\ntumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues from\\nthe radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend-\\ning on the dosage of radiation needed and then it is\\nremoved.

Again, with no other symptoms, the second\\nexam should take place before first grade. After first\\ngrade, the American Optometric Association recom-\\nmends an eye exam every two years; ages 19–40, every\\ntwo to three years; ages 41–60, every two years; and\\nannually after that. However, these are recommendations\\nfor healthy people with no risk factors. Patients should\\nask their doctors how often they should come for exams.\\nSome patients have risk factors for eye disease (e.g., peo-\\nple with diabetes or a family history of eye disease;\\nAfrican Americans, who are at higher risk for glaucoma)\\nand may need more frequent checkups. Also, if children\\nseem to be having trouble in school, problems with read-\\ning, rubbing their eyes when reading, etc., an eye exam\\nmay be necessary sooner.\\nPrecautions\\nThe examiner needs to know if the patient is taking\\nany medications or has any existing health conditions.\\nSome medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medica-\\ntions can affect vision or even interfere with the eyedrops\\nthe doctor may use during the exam. Certain eyedrops\\nwould not be used if the patient has asthma, heart prob-\\nlems, or other conditions.\\nThe patient may need someone to drive them home\\nin case the eyes were dilated. Bringing sunglasses to the\\nexam may also help decrease the glare from light until\\nthe dilating drops wear off.\\nDescription\\nAn eye examination, given by an ophthalmologist or\\noptometrist, costs about $100. It may or may not be cov-\\nered by insurance. It begins with information from the\\npatient (case history) and continues with a set of primary\\ntests, plus additional specialized tests given as needed, dic-\\ntated by the outcomes of initial testing and the patient’s\\nage. The primary tests can be divided into two groups,\\nthose that evaluate the physical state of the eyes and sur-\\nrounding areas, and those that measure the ability to see.\\nThe order of the tests for the exam may differ from\\ndoctor to doctor, however, most exams will include the\\nfollowing procedures:\\nInformation gathering and initial observations\\nThe examiner will take eye and medical histories that\\ninclude the patient’s chief complaint, any past eye disor-\\nders, all medications being taken (e.g., OTC medications,\\nantibiotics, and birth control pills), any blood relatives\\nwith eye disorders, and any systemic disorders the patient\\nmay have. The patient should also tell the doctor about\\nhobbies and work conditions. This information helps in\\nmodifying prescriptions and lets the doctor know how the\\npatient uses his or her eyes. For example, using a comput-\\ner screen vs. construction work, the working distance of a\\ncomputer screen may affect the prescription; the con-\\nstruction worker needs protective eyewear.\\nThe patient should bring their current pair of glasses\\nto the exam. The doctor can get the prescription from the\\nglasses by using an instrument called a lensometer.\\nVisual acuity examination\\nVisual acuity measures how clearly the patient can\\nsee. It is measured for each eye separately, with and\\nwithout the current prescription. It is usually measured\\nwith a Snellen eye chart, a poster with lines of different-\\nsized letters, each line with a number at the side denoting\\nthe distance from which a person with normal vision can\\nread that line. Other kinds of eye charts with identifiable\\nfigures are available for children or anyone unfamiliar\\nwith the Roman alphabet. These charts are made to be\\nplaced at a certain distance (usually 20 ft) from the per-\\nson being tested. At this distance, people with normal\\nvision can read a certain line (usually the lowest),\\nmarked the 20/20 line; these people are said to have\\n20/20 vision. For people who can’t read the smallest line,\\nthe examiner assigns a ratio based on the smallest line\\nthey can read. The first number (numerator) of the ratio\\nis the distance between the chart and the patient, and the\\nsecond number (denominator) is the distance where a\\nperson with normal vision would be able to read that\\nline. The ratio 20/40 means the patient can see at 20 ft.\\nwhat people with normal vision can see at 40 ft. away.\\nWhen a patient is unable to read any lines on the\\nchart, they are moved closer until they can read the line\\nwith the largest letters. The acuity is still measured the\\nsame way. A ratio of 5/200 means the person being tested\\ncan see at 5 ft what a normal person can see 200 ft.\\nWhen a patient can’t read the chart at all, the exam-\\niner may hold up some fingers and ask the patient to\\ncount them at various distances, and records the result as\\n“counting fingers” at the distance of recognition. If the\\npatient cannot count the examiner’s fingers at any dis-\\ntance, the examiner determines if the patient can see\\nhand movements. If so, the result is recorded as “hand\\nmovements.” If not, the examiner determines if the\\npatient can detect light from a penlight. If the patient can\\ndetect the light but not its direction, the result is recorded\\nat “light perception.” If the patient can recognize its\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1262\\nEye examination'),\n",

The examiner asks the patient to\\nstare at an object, then quickly covers one eye and notes\\nany movement in the eye that remains uncovered. This\\nprocedure is repeated with the other eye. This, and anoth-\\ner similar cover test, helps to determine if there is an\\nundetected eye turn or problem with fixation. The doctor\\nmay also have the patient look at a pen and follow it as it\\nis moved close to the eyes. This checks convergence.\\nIris and pupil examination\\nThe doctor checks the pupil’s response to light (if it\\ndilates and constricts appropriately). The iris is viewed\\nfor symmetry and physical appearance. The iris is\\nchecked more thoroughly later using a slit lamp.\\nRefractive error determination-Refraction\\nThe examiner will determine the refractive error and\\nobtain a prescription for corrective lenses for people\\nwhose visual acuity is less than 20/20. An instrument\\ncalled a phoropter, which the patient sits behind, is gen-\\nerally used (sometimes the refraction can be done with a\\ntrial frame that the patient wears). The phoropter is\\nequipped with many lenses that allow the examiner to\\ntest many combinations of corrections to learn which\\ncorrection allows the patient to see the eye chart most\\nclearly. This is the part of the exam when the doctor usu-\\nally says, “Which is better, one or two?” The phoropter\\nalso contains prisms, and sometimes the doctor will\\nintentionally make the patient see double. This may help\\nin determining a slight eye turn. The exam will check\\nvision at distance and near (reading).\\nA prescription for corrective lenses can also be sup-\\nplied by automated refracting devices, which measure\\nthe necessary refraction by shining a light into the eye\\nand observing the reflected light. Another objective way\\nto obtain a prescription is using a hand-held retinoscope.\\nAs in the automated method just mentioned, the doctor\\nshines a light in the patient’s eyes and can determine an\\nobjective prescription. This is helpful in young children\\nor infants.\\nSometimes drops will be instilled in the patient’s eyes\\nbefore this part of the exam. The drops may relax accom-\\nmodation so that the refraction will be more accurate. This\\nis helpful in children and people who are farsighted.\\nAfter the refraction and other visual status tests, for\\nexample color tests or binocularity tests (can the patient see\\n3-D, or have depth perception), the doctor will check the\\nhealth of the eyes and surrounding areas. The main instru-\\nments used are the ophthalmoscope and the slit lamp.\\nOphthalmoscopic examination\\nThese observations are best accomplished after\\ndilating the pupils and require an ophthalmoscope. The\\nophthalmoscope most frequently used is a called a direct\\nophthalmoscope . It is a hand-held illuminated 15X\\nmulti-lens magnifier that lets the examiner view the\\ninside back area of the eye (fundus). The retina, blood\\nvessels, optic nerve, and other structures are examined.\\nSlit lamp examination\\nThe slit lamp is a microscope with a light source that\\ncan be adjusted. This magnifies the external and some\\ninternal structures of the eyes. The lid and lid margin,\\ncornea, iris, pupil, conjunctiva, sclera, and lens are exam-\\nined. The slit lamp is also used in contact lens evalua-\\ntions. A little probe called a tonometer may be used at\\nthis time to check the pressure of the eyes. A colored eye-\\ndrop may be instilled immediately prior to this test. The\\ndrop has a local anesthetic so the patient won’t feel the\\nprobe touch the eye. It is a quick procedure.\\nVisual field measurement\\nA perimeter, the instrument for measuring visual\\nfields, is a hollow hemisphere, equipped with a light\\nsource that projects dots of light over the inside surface.\\nThe patient’s head is positioned so that the eye being\\ntested is at the center of the sphere and 13 in (about 33\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1263\\nEye examination\\nA woman looking through a refractor.(Photograph by John\\nGreim, Photo Researchers.

Eyeglass lenses are\\nmounted in frames worn on the face, sitting mostly on\\nthe ears and nose, so that the lenses are positioned in\\nfront of the eyes. Contact lenses appear to be worn in\\ndirect contact with the cornea, but they actually float on a\\nlayer of tears that separates them from the cornea.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of eyeglasses and contact lenses is to\\ncorrect or improve the vision of people with nearsighted-\\nness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), presbyopia,\\nand astigmatism.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople allergic to certain plastics should not wear\\ncontact lenses or eyeglass frames or lenses manufactured\\nfrom that type of plastic. People allergic to nickel should\\nnot wear Flexon frames. People at risk of being in acci-\\ndents that might shatter glass lenses should wear plastic\\nlenses, preferably polycarbonate. (Lenses made from\\npolycarbonate, the same type of plastic used for the\\nspace shuttle windshield, are about 50 times stronger\\nthan other lens materials.) Also, people at risk of receiv-\\ning electric shock should avoid metal frames.\\nPeople employed in certain occupations may be pro-\\nhibited from wearing contact lenses, or may be required\\nto wear safety eyewear over the contact lenses. Some\\noccupations, such as construction or auto repair, may\\nrequire safety lenses and safety frames. Physicians and\\nemployers should be consulted for recommendations.\\nDescription\\nEyes are examined by optometrists (O.D.) or by\\nophthalmologists (M.D. or D.O.—doctor of osteopathy).\\nPrescriptions, if necessary, are then given to patients for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1265\\nEye glasses and contact lenses'),\n",

The glasses are generally made by an optician. A\\nseparate contact lens-fitting exam is necessary if the\\npatient wants contact lenses, because an eyeglass pre-\\nscription is not the same as a contact lens prescription.\\nEyeglasses\\nOver 140 million people in the United States wear\\neyeglasses. People whose eyes have refractive errors do not\\nsee clearly without glasses, because the light emitted from\\nthe objects they are observing does not come into focus on\\ntheir retinas. For people who are farsighted, images come\\ninto focus behind the retina; for people who are nearsight-\\ned, images come into focus in front of the retina.\\nLENSES. Lenses work by changing the direction of\\nlight so that images come into focus on the retina. The\\ngreater the index of refraction of the lens material and the\\ngreater the difference in the curvature between the two\\nsurfaces of the lens, the greater the change in direction of\\nlight that passes through it, and the greater the correction.\\nLenses can be unifocal, with one correction for all\\ndistances, or they can be correct for more than one dis-\\ntance (multifocal). One type of multifocal, the bifocal,\\nhas an area of the lens (usually at the bottom) that cor-\\nrects for nearby objects (about 14 in from the eyes); the\\nremainder of the lens corrects for distant objects (about\\n20 ft from the eyes). Another type of multifocal, a trifo-\\ncal, has an area in-between that corrects for intermedi-\\nate distances (usually about 28 in). Conventional bifo-\\ncals and trifocals have visible lines between the areas of\\ndifferent correction; however, lenses where the correc-\\ntion gradually changes from one area to the other, with-\\nout visible lines, have been available since the 1970s.\\nSuch lenses are sometimes called progressives or no-\\nline bifocals.\\nTo be suitable for eyeglass lenses, a material must be\\ntransparent, without bubbles, and have a high index of\\nrefraction. The greater the index of refraction, the thinner\\nthe lens can be. Lenses are made from either glass or\\nplastic (hard resin). The advantage of plastic is that it is\\nlightweight and more impact resistant than glass. The\\nadvantage of glass is that it is scratch resistant and pro-\\nvides the clearest possible vision.\\nGlass was the first material to be used for eyeglass\\nlenses, and was used for several hundred years before\\nplastic was introduced. The crown glass used for eye-\\nglass lenses has an index of refraction of 1.52.\\nOptical-quality acrylic was introduced for eyeglass\\nuse in the early 1940s, but because it was easily\\nscratched, brittle, and discolored rapidly, it did not sup-\\nplant glass as the material of choice. Furthermore, it had\\na relatively low index of refraction, so it wasn’t suitable\\nfor people with large refractive errors. A plastic called\\nCR-39, introduced in the 1960s, was more suitable.\\nToday, eyeglass wearers can also choose between poly-\\ncarbonate, which is the most impact-resistant material\\navailable for eyewear, and polyurethane, which has\\nexceptional optical qualities and an index of refraction of\\nup to 1.66, much higher than the conventional plastics\\nused for lenses, and even higher than glass. Patients with\\nhigh prescriptions should ask about high index material\\noptions for their lenses. Aspheric lenses are also useful\\nfor high prescriptions. They are flatter and lighter than\\nconventional lenses.\\nThere are many lenses and lens-coating options for\\nindividual needs, including coatings that block the ultra-\\nviolet (UV) light or UV and blue light which have been\\nfound to be harmful to the eyes. Such coatings are not\\nneeded on polycarbonate lenses, which already have UV\\nprotection. UV coatings are particularly important on\\nsunglasses and ski goggles. Sunglasses, when nonpre-\\nscription, should be labeled with an indication that they\\nblock out 99–100% of both UV-A and UV-B rays.\\nThere are anti-scratch coatings that increase the\\nsurface hardness of lenses (an important feature when\\nusing plastic lenses) and anti-reflective (AR) coatings\\nthat eliminate almost all glare and allow other people to\\nsee the eyes of the wearer. AR coatings may be particu-\\nlarly helpful to people who use computers or who drive\\nat night. Mirror coatings that prevent other people from\\nseeing the wearer’s eyes are also available. There is a\\nwhole spectrum of tints, from light tints to darker tints,\\nused in sunglasses. Tint, however, does not block-out\\nUV rays, so a UV coating is needed. Polaroid lenses\\nthat block out much of the reflected light also allow bet-\\nter vision in sunny weather and are helpful for people\\nwho enjoy boating. Photosensitive (photochromatic)\\nlenses that darken in the presence of bright light are\\nhandy for people who don’t want to carry an extra set of\\nglasses. Photochromatic lenses are available in glass\\nand plastic.\\nFRAMES. Frames can be made from metal or plastic,\\nand they can be rimless. There is an almost unlimited\\nvariety of shapes, colors, and sizes. The type and degree\\nof refractive correction in the lens determine to some\\nextent the type of frame most suitable. Some lenses are\\ntoo thick to fit in metal rims, and some large-correction\\nprescriptions are best suited to frames with small-area\\nlenses.\\nRimless frames are the least noticeable type, and they\\nare lightweight because the nosepiece and temples are\\nattached directly to the lenses, eliminating the weight of\\nthe rims.

Epoxy\\nframes are resilient and return to their original shape after\\nbeing deformed, so they do not need to be adjusted as fre-\\nquently as other types. Nylon frames are almost unbreak-\\nable.

Bifocal\\nheights also have to be measured with the chosen frame\\nin place and adjusted on the patient. Again, this is so the\\nlenses will be positioned correctly. If not positioned cor-\\nrectly, the patient may experience eyestrain or other\\nproblems. This can occur with over-the-counter reading\\nglasses. The distance between the lenses is for a “stan-\\ndard” person. Generally, this will not be a problem, but if\\na patient is sensitive or has more closely set eyes, for\\nexample, it may pose a problem. Persons buying ready-\\nmade sunglasses or reading glasses should hold them up\\nto see if they appear clear. They should also hold the\\nlenses to see an object with straight lines reflected off of\\nthe lenses. If the lines don’t appear straight, the lenses\\nmay be warped or inferior.\\nPatients may sometimes need a few days to adjust to\\na new prescription; however, problems should be report-\\ned, because the glasses may need to be rechecked.\\nContact lenses\\nOver 32 million people in the United States wear\\nthese small lenses that fit on top of the cornea. They pro-\\nvide a field of view unobstructed by eyeglass frames;\\nthey do not fog-up or get splattered, so it is possible to\\nsee well while walking in the rain; and they are less\\nnoticeable than any eyeglass style. On the other hand,\\nthey take time to get accustomed to; require more mea-\\nsurements for fitting; require many follow-up visits to\\nthe eye doctor; can lead to complications such as infec-\\ntions and corneal damage; and may not correct astigma-\\ntism as well as eyeglasses, especially if the astigmatism\\nis severe.\\nOriginally, hard contact lenses were made of a mate-\\nrial called PMMA. Although still available, the more\\ncommon types of contact lenses are listed below:\\n• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) daily-wear lenses are made\\nof plastic that does not absorb water but allows oxygen\\nto get from the atmosphere to the cornea. (This is\\nimportant because the cornea has no blood supply and\\nneeds to get its oxygen from the atmosphere through\\nthe film of tears that moves beneath the lens.) They\\nmust be removed and cleaned each night.\\n• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) extended-wear lenses are\\nmade from plastic that also does not absorb water but is\\nmore permeable to oxygen than the plastic used for\\ndaily-wear lenses. They can be worn up to a week.\\n• Daily wear soft lenses are made of plastic that is per-\\nmeable to oxygen and absorbs water; therefore, they\\nare soft and flexible. These lenses must be removed\\nand cleaned each night, and they do not correct all\\nvision problems. Soft lenses are easier to get used to\\nthan rigid lenses, but are more prone to tears and do\\nnot last as long.\\n• Extended-wear soft lenses are highly permeable to oxy-\\ngen, are flexible by virtue of their ability to absorb\\nwater, and can usually be worn for up to one week.\\nThey do not correct all vision problems. There is more\\nof a risk of infection with extended-wear lenses than\\nwith daily-wear lenses.\\n• Extended-wear disposable lenses are soft lenses worn\\ncontinually for up to six days and then discarded, with\\nno need for cleaning.\\n• Planned-replacement soft lenses are daily wear lenses\\nthat are replaced on a regular schedule, which is usually\\nevery two weeks, monthly, or quarterly. They must also\\nbe cleaned.\\nSoft contact lenses come in a variety of materials.\\nThere are also different kinds of RGP and soft multifocal\\ncontact lenses available. Monovision, where one contact\\nlens corrects for distance vision while the other corrects\\nfor near vision, may be an option for presbyopic patients.\\nMonovision, however, may affect depth perception and\\nmay not be appropriate for everyone.

To achieve binocular vision, the\\ngoal is to align the eyes so that the location of the image\\non the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of the\\nimage on the retina of the other eye.\\nIn addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help\\npeople with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane\\nsyndrome, for example).\\nPrecautions\\nDepth perception (stereopsis) develops around the\\nage of three months old. For successful development of\\nbinocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen-\\nsionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the age\\nof four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, so\\nan early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even be\\nperformed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu-\\nlar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis-\\nes (vision therapy) will probably be necessary.\\nDescription\\nThe extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the\\nsclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering of\\nthe eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginary\\nequator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye.\\nThe other end of each of these muscles attaches to a part\\nof the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These muscles\\nenable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or the\\nother, or any angle in between.\\nNormally both eyes move together, receive the same\\nimage on corresponding locations on both retinas, and the\\nbrain fuses these images into one three-dimensional\\nimage. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder\\nwhere one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, most\\noften outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose\\n(esotropia). The brain now receives two different images,\\nand either suppresses one or the person sees double\\n(diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakening\\nor strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyes\\ntoward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward,\\nthe muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened.\\nRarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people\\nwith nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con-\\ndition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; it\\ncan sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi-\\ntion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorder\\nwhere there is limited horizontal eye movement; it can\\nsometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle.\\nThere are two methods to alter extraocular muscles.\\nTraditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, or\\nreposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon first\\nmakes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membrane\\ncovering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle to\\nprevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle from\\nthe eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, the\\nmuscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle is\\nremoved so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle is\\nreattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle.\\nIn a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition-\\ning it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might be\\noperated on at the same time.\\nAnother way of weakening eye muscles, using botu-\\nlinum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced in\\nthe early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off,\\nthe realignment may be permanent, depending upon\\nwhether neurological connections for binocular vision\\nwere established during the time the toxin was active.\\nThis technique can also be used to adjust a muscle after\\ntraditional surgery.\\nThe cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000–\\n$4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu-\\nally in the United States.\\nPreparation\\nPatients should make sure their doctors are aware of\\nany medications that they are taking, even over-the-\\ncounter medications. Patients should not take aspirin,o r\\nany other blood-thinning medications for ten days prior\\nto surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight the\\nnight before.\\nAftercare\\nPatients will need someone to drive them home after\\ntheir surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin and\\nother non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi-\\ntional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g.,\\nTylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon to\\nbe clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain\\nwill subside after two to three days, and patients can\\nresume most normal activities within a few days. Again,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1269\\nEye muscle surgery'),\n",

More likely, the gland\\nopening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble a\\nstye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also be\\nlocated in the middle of the lid and be internal.\\nBlepharitis\\nBlepharitis is the inflammation of the eyelid mar-\\ngins, often with scales and crust. It can lead to eyelash\\nloss, chalazia, styes, ectropion, corneal damage, exces-\\nsive tearing, and chronic conjunctivitis.\\nEntropion\\nEntropion is a condition where the eyelid margin\\n(usually the lower one) is turned inward; the eyelashes\\ntouch the eye and irritate the cornea.\\nEctropion\\nEctropion is a condition where one or both eyelid\\nmargins turn outward, exposing both the conjunctiva that\\ncovers the eye and the conjunctiva that lines the eyelid.\\nEyelid edema\\nEyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con-\\ntain excessive fluid.\\nEyelid tumors\\nEyelids are susceptible to the same skin tumors as\\nthe skin over the rest of the body, including noncancer-\\nous tumors and cancerous tumors (basal cell carcinoma,\\nsquamous cell carcinoma,malignant melanoma , and\\nsebaceous gland carcinoma). Eyelid muscles are suscep-\\ntible to sarcoma.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nStye\\nStyes are usually caused by bacterial staphylococcal\\ninfections. The symptoms are pain and inflammation in\\none or more localized regions near the eyelid margin.\\nChalazion\\nA chalazion is caused by a blockage in the outflow\\nduct of a meibomian gland. Symptoms are inflammation\\nand swelling in the form of a round lump in the lid that\\nmay be painful.\\nBlepharitis\\nSome cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial\\ninfection and some by head lice, but in some cases, the\\ncause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc-\\ntion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be a\\nchronic condition that begins in early childhood and can\\nlast throughout life. Symptoms can include itching, burn-\\ning, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation,\\nand scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes.\\nEntropion\\nEntropion usually results from aging, but sometimes\\ncan be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle,\\nor a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from\\nsurgery, injury, or disease. It is accompanied by exces-\\nsive tearing, redness, and discomfort.\\nEctropion\\nSimilar to entropion, the usual cause of ectropion is\\naging. It also can be due to a spastic eyelid muscle or a\\nscar, as in entropion. It also can be the result of allergies.\\nSymptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of the\\neyelid conjunctiva.\\nEyelid edema\\nEyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac-\\ntions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops or\\nother drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis,\\na disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causes\\neyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused by\\nmore serious causes, such as infection, and can lead to\\norbital cellulitis which can threaten vision.

They are usually painless and may or may not be\\npigmented. Some possible causes include AIDS\\n(Kaposi’s sarcoma) or increased exposure to ultraviolet\\n(UV) rays which may lead to skin cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn instrument called a slit lamp is generally used to\\nmagnify the structures of the eyes. The doctor may press\\non the lid margin to see if oil can be expressed from the\\nmeibomian glands. The doctor may invert the lid to see\\nthe inside of the lid. Biopsy is used to diagnose cancer-\\nous tumors.\\nTreatment\\nStye\\nStyes are treated with warm-hot compresses for\\n10–15 minutes, three to four times a day. Sometimes top-\\nical antibiotics may be prescribed. If the initial treatment\\nis ineffective, styes are lanced and drained.\\nChalazion\\nAbout 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous-\\nly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Because\\nchalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener-\\nally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected by\\nthe doctor into the chalazion or if that doesn’t help the\\nchalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be a\\nchalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, the\\npossibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should be\\ninvestigated by biopsy.\\nBlepharitis\\nBlepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with\\nantibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with a\\nmoist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Good\\nhygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesn’t clear up\\nwith treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, the\\npatient may have acnerosacea. These patients may need\\nto see a dermatologist as well.\\nEntropion and ectropion\\nBoth entropion and ectropion can be surgically cor-\\nrected. Prior to surgery, the lower lid of entropion can be\\ntaped down to keep the lashes off the eye, and both can be\\ntreated with lubricating drops to keep the cornea moist.\\nEyelid edema\\nPatients with swollen eyelids should contact their\\neye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eye\\nand possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec-\\ntion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as an\\nallergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes can\\ncause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelid\\nedema is to find and remove the substance causing the\\nallergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plant\\nallergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesive\\ndrugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev-\\ner, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular\\npressure and patients must be very careful not to get the\\ncream in their eyes. This should not be done unless under\\na doctor’s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, the\\ntrichinosis must be treated.\\nEyelid tumors\\nCancerous tumors should be removed upon discov-\\nery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed before\\nthey become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelid\\nfunction. Eyelid tumors require special consideration\\nbecause of their sensitive location. It is important that\\ntreatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye-\\nlid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction will\\nsometimes accompany tumor excision.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to\\nexcellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, and\\nentropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosis\\nfor nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa-\\nmous cell carcinoma is good once they are properly\\nremoved. Survival rate for malignant melanoma depends\\nupon how early it was discovered and if it was complete-\\nly removed.

The procedure is designed to counter sagging\\nand looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi-\\nty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase all\\nfacial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literally\\nmeans “surgical removal of wrinkles”) might imply.\\nWrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, may\\nbenefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures,\\nsuch as blepharoplasty, chemical peel, or dermabrasion,\\nalso may be necessary.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with other medical conditions should consult\\nwith their primary physician before undergoing face lift\\nsurgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain other\\nconditions can lead to a higher risk of complications.\\nPatients who take medications that can alter the way their\\nblood clots (including female hormones,aspirin, and\\nsome non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med-\\nications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematoma\\nwill form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin,\\nis the most frequent complication of face lift surgery.\\nDescription\\nFace lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient\\nbasis with local anesthetics. Patients typically also\\nreceive “twilight anesthesia,” an intravenous sedative that\\nhelps to lower their awareness of the procedure being\\nperformed.\\nThere are a number of variations of face lift surgery.\\nWhich one is used will depend on the patient’s facial\\nstructure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer-\\nences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi-\\ncal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci-\\nsion within the hairline just above the ear. The incision\\ncontinues down along the front edge of the ear, around the\\nearlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending back\\ninto the hairline. The location of this incision is designed\\nto hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce-\\ndure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari-\\nous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate the\\nskin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving down\\nto the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fat\\ndeposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removed\\nsurgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon\\nwill then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus-\\ncle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below the\\nchin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis-\\nsue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear-\\nance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excess\\nskin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skin\\nback, and staples or sutures it into place.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to the procedure, patients meet with their sur-\\ngeon to discuss the surgery, clarify the results that can be\\nachieved, and discuss the potential problems that can\\noccur. Having realistic expectations is important in any\\ncosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that\\nalthough face lift surgery can improve the contour of the\\nface and neck, other procedures will be necessary to\\nreduce the appearance of many wrinkles.

Some surgeons also\\nrecommend antibiotics be taken beforehand to limit the\\nrisk of infection. Some surgeons also use a steroid injec-\\ntion before or after the procedure, to reduce swelling.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied\\nto the face to reduce the risk of hematoma.

The name facti-\\ntious comes from a Latin word that means artificial.\\nThese disorders are not malingering, which is defined as\\npretending illness when the “patient” has a clear motive,\\nsuch as financial gain.\\nDescription\\nPatients with factitious disorders produce or exag-\\ngerate the symptoms of a physical or mental illness by a\\nvariety of methods, including contaminating urine sam-\\nples with blood, taking hallucinogens, injecting them-\\nselves with bacteria to produce infections, and other sim-\\nilar behaviors.\\nThere are no reliable statistics on the frequency of\\nfactitious disorders, but they are more common in men\\nthan in women. The following conditions are sometimes\\nclassified as factitious disorders:\\nMunchausen syndrome\\nMunchausen syndromerefers to patients whose\\nfactitious symptoms are dramatized and exaggerated.\\nMany persons with Munchausen go so far as to undergo\\nmajor surgery repeatedly, and, to avoid detection, at sev-\\neral locations. Many have been employed in hospitals or\\nin health care professions. The syndrome’s onset is in\\nearly adulthood.\\nMunchausen by proxy\\nMunchausen by proxy is the name given to facti-\\ntious disorders in children produced by parents or\\nother caregivers. The parent may falsify the child’s\\nmedical history or tamper with laboratory tests in\\norder to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, they\\nmay actually injure the child to assure that the child\\nwill be treated.\\nGanser’s syndrome\\nGanser’s syndrome is an unusual dissociative reac-\\ntion to extreme stress in which the patient gives absurd\\nor silly answers to simple questions. It has sometimes\\nbeen labeled as psychiatric malingering, but is more\\noften classified as a factitious disorder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNo single explanation of factitious disorders covers\\nall cases. These disorders are variously attributed to\\nunderlying personality disorders; child abuse; the wish\\nto repeat a satisfying childhood relationship with a doc-\\ntor; and the desire to deceive or test authority figures.\\nAlso, the wish to assume the role of patient and be cared\\nfor is involved. In many cases, the suffering of a major\\npersonal loss has been implicated.\\nThe following are regarded as indications of a facti-\\ntious disorder:\\n• dramatic but inconsistent medical history\\n• extensive knowledge of medicine and/or hospitals\\n• negative test results followed by further symptom\\ndevelopment\\n• symptoms that occur only when the patient is not being\\nobserved\\n• few visitors\\n• arguments with hospital staff or similar acting-out\\nbehaviors\\n• eagerness to undergo operations and other procedures\\nWhen patients with factitious disorders are confront-\\ned, they usually deny that their symptoms are intentional.\\nThey may become angry and leave the hospital. In many\\ncases they enter another hospital, which has led to the\\nnickname “hospital hoboes.”\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1277\\nFactitious disorders'),\n",

It is usually applied to\\ninfants and children up to two years of age who do not\\ngain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thrive\\nis not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptoms\\nwhich may come from a variety of sources.\\nDescription\\nShortly after birth most infants loose some weight.\\nAfter that expected loss, babies should gain weight at a\\nsteady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gain\\nweigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is not\\nthriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or more\\nconditions.\\nOrganic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the\\norgans involved with digestion and absorption of food\\nare malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digest\\nits food. Non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) is the\\nmost common cause of FTT and implies the baby is not\\nreceiving enough food due to economic factors or\\nparental neglect, or do to psychosocial problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOccasionally, there may be an underlying physical\\ncondition that inhibits the baby’s ability to take in, digest,\\nor process food. These defects can occur in the esopha-\\ngus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus.\\nUsually the defect is an incomplete development of the\\norgan, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physical\\ndefects can be detected shortly after birth.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21278\\nFailure to thrive'),\n",

This can be\\ndue to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs and\\nconcepts of nutrition, or neglect of the child. In addition,\\nif the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity of\\nthe mother’s milk may be the source of the problem.\\nPsychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack\\nof nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure to\\nthrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres-\\nsion from insufficient attention from parents.\\nInfants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially\\nless than expected, are considered to be suffering from\\nFTT.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost babies are weighed at birth and that weight is\\nused as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If the\\nbaby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc-\\ntor will do a more extensive examination. If there are no\\napparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, the\\ndoctor will examine the child’s environment. As part of\\nthat examination, the doctor will look at the family histo-\\nry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will be\\nasked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. If\\nthe mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluate\\nher diet, general health, and well being as it affects the\\nquantity and quality of her milk.\\nDiagnosis of FTT is confirmed by a positive growth\\nand behavioral response to increased nutrition.\\nTreatment\\nIf there is an underlying physical reason for failure\\nto thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism or\\nintestinal problems, correcting that problem should\\nreverse the condition. If the condition is caused by envi-\\nronmental factors, the physician will suggest several\\nways parents may provide adequate food for the child.\\nMaternal education and parental counseling may also be\\nrecommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or a\\nmore nurturing home may be necessary.\\nPrognosis\\nThe first year of life is important as a foundation for\\ngrowth and physical and intellectual development in the\\nfuture. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the first\\nyear may never catch up to their peers even if their physi-\\ncal growth improves.

No matter how trivial it seems, a\\nfainting episode should be treated as a medical emer-\\ngency until the cause is determined.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nExtreme pain, fear, or stress may bring on fainting.\\nThis type of fainting is caused by overstimulation of the\\nvagus nerve, a nerve connected to the brain that helps con-\\ntrol breathing and circulation. In addition, a person who\\nstands still or erect for too long may faint. This type of\\nfainting occurs because blood pools in the leg veins,\\nreducing the amount that is available for the heart to pump\\nto the brain. This type of fainting is quite common in older\\npeople or those taking drugs to treat high blood pressure.\\nWhen an older person feels faint upon turning the\\nhead or looking upward suddenly, the cause could be\\nosteoarthritisof the neck bones. Osteoarthritis damages\\nthe cartilage between the neck bones and causes pressure\\non blood vessels leading to the brain.\\nFainting can be a symptom of a disease such as\\nStokes-Adams syndrome, a condition in which blood\\nflow to the brain is temporarily reduced because of an\\nirregular heartbeat. Some people may experience fainting\\nassociated with weakness in the limbs or a temporary\\nproblem in speaking caused by obstructed blood flow in\\nvessels passing through the neck to the brain. Pregnant\\nwomen frequently feel faint. Fainting may also occur as a\\nresult of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can occur if a\\nperson skips a meal or has diabetes.\\nFainting can also be caused by:\\n• prolonged coughing\\n• straining to defecate or urinate\\n• blowing a wind instrument too hard\\n• remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen\\nSometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary\\ndrop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a tran-\\nsient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a\\nmini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the\\nbrain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel. Seek\\nhelp immediately if a fainting spell is followed by one or\\nmore of the symptoms listed below:\\n• numbness or tingling in any body part\\n• blurred vision\\n• confusion\\n• difficulty speaking\\n• loss of movement in arms or legs\\nA few seconds before fainting, a person may sweat\\nor become pale, feel nauseated or dizzy, and have blurred\\nvision or racing heartbeat. Once the person loses con-\\nsciousness, the pupils may dilate as the heart rate slows\\ndown. There may be abnormal movements. Muscles may\\ntighten or the back may arch. These movements do not\\nlast long and they are not violent.\\nIn most cases, the patient regains consciousness\\nwithin a few minutes, but the fainting spell may be fol-\\nlowed by nervousness,headache, nausea, dizziness, pal-\\nlor or sweating. The person may faint again, especially if\\nhe or she stands up within 30 minutes.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost episodes of fainting are a one-time occurrence.\\nWhen a person experiences repeated fainting spells, a\\nphysician should be consulted.\\nTreatment\\nMost of the time, a person who faints ends up lying\\non the floor. If this happens, the patient should be rolled\\nonto his or her back. Because someone who faints often\\nvomits, bystanders should keep the airway open.

It is not entirely\\nclear what brings on an attack, but people with FMF\\noften report mild physical trauma, physical exertion, or\\nemotional stress just prior to the onset of symptoms.\\nTreatment for FMF involves an oral medication called\\ncolchicine, which is highly effective for the episodes of\\nfever and pain, as well as for amyloidosis and the kidney\\ndisease that can result from it.\\nFMF is most common in certain ethnic groups from\\nthe eastern Mediterranean region, but cases in other eth-\\nnic groups in other parts of the world are increasingly\\nbeing reported. FMF is also known by many other\\nnames. They include: recurrent hereditary polyserositis,\\nbenign paroxysmal peritonitis, familial paroxysmal pol-\\nyserositis, paroxysmal polyserositis, familial recurrent\\npolyserositis, periodic fever, periodic amyloid syndrome,\\nperiodic peritonitis syndrome, Reimann periodic disease,\\nReimann syndrome, Siegel-Cattan-Mamou syndrome,\\nand Armenian syndrome.\\nEstimates of the incidence of FMF in specific east-\\nern Mediterranean populations range from 1 in 2000 to 1\\nin 100, depending on the population studied. Specific\\nmutations in the MEFV gene are more common in cer-\\ntain ethnic groups, and may cause a somewhat different\\ncourse of the disease. A few mutations in the MEFV\\ngene likely became common in a small population in the\\neastern Mediterranean several thousand years ago. It is\\npostulated that carrying a single copy of a mutated gene\\nproduced a modified (but not abnormal) inflammatory\\nresponse that may have been protective against some\\ninfectious agent at that time. Those who carried a single\\n“beneficial” mutation in the MEFV gene were more like-\\nly to survive and reproduce, which may explain the high\\ncarrier frequency (up to one in five) in some populations.\\nPeople of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and\\nTurkish ancestry are at greatest risk for FMF. However, a\\nbetter understanding and recognition of the symptoms of\\nFMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of the\\ncondition in other ethnic groups, such as Italians and\\nArmenian-Americans.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFMF is a genetic condition inherited in an autosomal\\nrecessive fashion. Mutations in the MEFV gene (short\\nfor Mediterranean Fever) on chromosome number 16 are\\nthe underlying cause of FMF. Autosomal recessive inher-\\nitance implies that a person with FMF has mutations in\\nboth copies of the MEFV gene. All genes come in pairs,\\nand one copy of each pair is inherited from each parent.\\nIf neither parent of a child with FMF has the condition, it\\nmeans they carry one mutated copy of the MEFV gene,\\nbut also one normal copy, which is enough to protect\\nthem from disease. If both parents carry the same autoso-\\nmal recessive gene, there is a one in four chance in each\\npregnancythat the child will inherit both recessive\\ngenes, and thus have the condition.\\nThe MEFV gene carries the instructions for produc-\\ntion of a protein called pyrin, named for pyrexia, a med-\\nical term for fever. The research group in France that co-\\ndiscovered the protein named it marenostrin, after ancient\\nLatin words that referred to the Mediterranean Sea. The\\nmovement of neutrophils into an area of the body where\\ntrauma or infection has occurred is the major cause of\\ninflammation, which is a normal process. Research has\\nshown that pyrin has some function in controlling neu-\\ntrophils. In a situation where minor trauma or stress\\noccurs, some initial inflammation may follow, but a func-\\ntional pyrin protein is responsible for shutting-down the\\nresponse of neutrophils once they are no longer needed.\\nAn abnormal pyrin protein associated with FMF may be\\npartly functional, but unstable. In some instances, the\\nabnormal pyrin itself seems to be “stressed”, and loses its\\nability to regulate neutrophils and inflammation. Left\\nunregulated, a normal, mild inflammation spirals out of\\ncontrol. Exactly what causes pyrin in FMF to lose its abil-\\nity to control neutrophils in some situations is not known.\\nThe recurrent acute attacks of FMF typically begin\\nin childhood or adolescence. Episodes of fever and\\npainful inflammation usually last 12–72 hours. About\\n90% of people with FMF have their first attack by age\\n20.

Fevers occur for many reasons, and nonspecific\\npains in the abdomen, chest, and joints are also frequent\\nailments. Several infections can result in symptoms simi-\\nlar to FMF (Mallaret meningitis, for instance), and many\\npeople with FMF undergo exploratory abdominal surgery\\nand ineffective treatments before they are finally diag-\\nnosed. Membership in a less commonly affected ethnic\\ngroup may delay or hinder the correct diagnosis.\\nIn general, symptoms involving one or more of the\\nfollowing broad groups should lead to suspicion of FMF:\\nUnexplained recurrent fevers, polyserositis, skin rash,\\nand/or joint pain; abnormal blood studies (see below);\\nand renal or other disease associated with amyloidosis. A\\nfamily history of FMF or its symptoms would obviously\\nbe an important clue, but the recessive nature of FMF\\nmeans there usually is no family history. The diagnosis\\nmay be confirmed when a person with unexplained fever\\nand pain responds to treatment with colchicine since\\ncolchicine is not known to have a beneficial effect on any\\nother condition similar to FMF. Abnormal results on a\\nblood test typically include leukocytosis (elevated num-\\nber of neutrophils in the blood), an increased erythro-\\ncyte sedimentation rate (rate at which red blood cells\\nform a sediment in a blood sample), and increased levels\\nof proteins associated with inflammation (called acute\\nphase reactants) such as SAA.\\nDirect analysis of the MEFV gene for FMF muta-\\ntions is the only method to be certain of the diagnosis.\\nHowever, it is not yet possible to detect all MEFV gene\\nmutations that might cause FMF. Thus, if DNA analysis\\nis negative, clinical methods must be relied upon. If both\\nmembers of a couple were proven to be FMF carriers\\nthrough genetic testing, highly accurate prenatal diagno-\\nsis would be available in any subsequent pregnancy.\\nSimilar syndromes of periodic fever and inflamma-\\ntion include familial Hibernian fever and hyperim-\\nmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, but both are more rare\\nthan FMF.\\nTreatment\\nColchicine is a chemical compound that can be used\\nas a medication, and is frequently prescribed for gout.\\nSome years ago, colchicine was discovered to also be\\neffective in reducing the frequency and severity of\\nattacks in FMF. Treatment for FMF at this point consists\\nof taking colchicine daily. Studies have shown that about\\n75% of FMF patients achieve complete remission of\\ntheir symptoms, and about 95% show marked improve-\\nment when taking colchicine. Lower effectiveness has\\nbeen reported, but there is some question about the num-\\nber of FMF patients who choose not to take their\\ncolchicine between attacks when they are feeling well,\\nand thus lose some of the ability to prevent attacks. Com-\\npliance with taking colchicine every day may be ham-\\npered by its side effects, which include diarrhea, nausea,\\nabdominal bloating, and gas. There is a theoretical risk\\nthat colchicine use could damage chromosomes in\\nsperms and eggs, or in an embryo during pregnancy, or\\nthat it might reduce fertility. However, studies looking at\\nreproduction in men and women who have used\\ncolchicine have so far not shown any increased risks.\\nColchicine is also effective in preventing, delaying, or\\nreversing renal disease associated with amyloidosis.\\nOther medications may be used as needed to deal\\nwith the pain and fever associated with FMF attacks.\\nDialysis and/or renal transplant might become necessary\\nin someone with advanced kidney disease.

Most will have very few, if any, attacks of\\nfever and polyserositis, and will likely not develop seri-\\nous complications of amyloidosis.

Polzin, M.S.\\nFamilial polyposis\\nDefinition\\nFamilial polyposis is an inherited condition which\\nprimarily affects the large intestine (colon and rectum).\\nLarge numbers of projecting masses of swollen and\\nthickened or tumorous membrane (polyps) develop on\\nthe inner lining of this part of the bowel. The polyps\\neventually become malignant.\\nDescription\\nFamilial polyposis (FP) is known by many syn-\\nonyms, most include some combination of words which\\nreflect what is known about the disease. As the disease is\\ninherited, the word, family, is often included. Because\\nthese mushroom-like growths are the most obvious mani-\\nfestation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually in\\nthe term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind of\\npolyp that is typically discovered. Some of the names\\nfound in medical texts and journals include polyposis\\ncoli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo-\\nsis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosis\\nof the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma-\\ntous polyposis (FAP). The last term and its abbreviation\\nhave been commonly used since the early 1990s. It will\\nbe used in this discussion.\\nFamilial polyposis or familial adenomatous poly-\\nposis (FAP) is a premalignant disease. This means that\\na person with FAP, if left untreated, will invariably\\ndevelop cancer . Individuals with this disorder grow\\nhundreds of polyps throughout their large intestines.\\nThe polyps, which may also be called adenomas, com-\\nmonly develop just after puberty . Approximately half\\nof all FAP patients will have polyps by age 14. Ninety\\npercent will have detectable polyps by age 25. Usually\\nby age 35–40, one or more of these polyps will become\\ncancerous.\\nFAP is a rare disease. One in 8,000 people in the\\nUnited States have FAP. However, it may be very com-\\nmon in affected families. FAP is inherited in an autoso-\\nmal dominant pattern. This means that a person with FAP\\nhas a 50% chance of passing the condition down to each\\nof their children. FAP can also develop in someone with\\nno family history of the disorder, due to a new genetic\\nmutation in that individual. It is thought that approxi-\\nmately one percent of all colorectal cancers in the United\\nStates can be attributed to FAP.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or\\nchanges. The original cause of the mutation is unknown.\\nIts exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researchers\\ntheorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture of\\na protein which helps control cell growth. The mutated\\ngene section in FAP generates an abnormal protein\\nwhich does not perform its normal function. Cells grow\\nout of control, causing the development of multiple,\\nsometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of these\\neventually becomes cancerous.\\nMany individuals develop polyps without display-\\ning any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti-\\nnal problems as diarrhea , constipation , abdominal\\ncramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patients\\nmay also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoid\\ntumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. In\\naddition, they may exhibit a “spot” on the retina of the\\neye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment\\nepithelium, or CHRPE).\\nRelatives of individuals with diagnosed FAP are at\\nhigh risk of having the disease themselves. There are no\\nother known risk factors for this condition.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1285\\nFamilial polyposis'),\n",

A blood test can then be\\nperformed which identifies family members who have the\\nsame mutation. They will eventually develop the condi-\\ntion. Children who have a parent with FAP, and siblings of\\naffected patients whose parental history is incomplete,\\nshould be evaluated. The polyps characteristic of FAP\\nhave been found in children as young as age five. Testing\\nof appropriate individuals should take place as soon as the\\ndiagnosis of FAP is established in one member of a family.\\nRelatives of people with diagnosed FAP should\\nexercise caution regarding where they seek advice and\\ntesting. One study of a commercially available blood test\\nfound that less than 20% of patients received any genetic\\ncounseling, and almost one third of their physicians mis-\\ninterpreted the test results.\\nRegistries for FAP patients can be found at many\\nsites in the United States. Such a registry specializes in\\nidentification, assistance, and education of people with a\\nparticular disease, and is usually a separate department in\\na research hospital. A team of health professionals who\\nhave expertise in the disorder staff the registry.\\nTesting within a research setting and/or at a facility\\nwith a registry of patients with FAP is more likely to\\nsafeguard against problems, such as the misunderstand-\\ning of test results. As part of a research project, some-\\ntimes counseling as well as blood tests are available at no\\ncharge to the patient. Insurance coverage varies. Con-\\ncerns about confidentiality, and future insurance and\\nemployment discrimination, may prompt individuals to\\npay for the examination out of pocket. Commercial blood\\ntests cost approximately $250 per sample.\\nIf the abnormal gene is found in a family member,\\nannual screening for colon polyps is recommended,\\nbeginning at age 11. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is used for\\nthis examination. It is usually done in a physician’s\\noffice, or in a hospital department, most often by a gas-\\ntroenterologist or a surgeon. Food intake may be restrict-\\ned for 24 hours prior to the procedure. Before the study,\\nthe intestine is cleared of stool by one or more small ene-\\nmas. Some physicians prefer to sedate the patient, to\\nhelp them relax. Then a flexible, lighted, hollow tube\\n(sigmoidoscope) is inserted into the anus and maneu-\\nvered into the large intestine. The physician examines the\\nwall of the colon to look for polyps. If polyps are found,\\none or more may be removed for biopsy.\\nMost patients report little discomfort during the\\nexamination. The procedure itself takes five to fifteen\\nminutes. The patient may be at the facility an hour, or\\nmore, if recovery from sedation is needed. If no medica-\\ntion was administered, driving and resumption of normal\\nactivities are permitted immediately. The cost of the pro-\\ncedure varies widely, but, as of 1997, it was covered by\\nMedicare, indicating the likelihood of other types of\\ninsurance coverage.\\nIn some cases the portion of the gene responsible for\\nFAP cannot be identified. Family members of these\\npatients cannot have a predictive blood test. The current\\nrecommendation is for these patients to have the same\\nannual examination with flexible sigmoidoscopy as\\npatients with a diagnosed FAP gene. A noninvasive\\nscreening eye examination to detect CHRPE, associated\\nwith FAP, may also be performed.\\nTreatment\\nThe only definitive treatment for FAP is surgical\\nremoval of the lower intestine. Since the goal is to pre-\\nvent cancer, the operation is done as soon as adenoma-\\ntous polyps are found on sigmoidoscopy. Waiting until a\\npolyp becomes malignant is unsafe, as the cancer may\\ninvade surrounding tissues.\\nThere are several choices about the type of surgery to\\ntreat this condition. Some authorities advocate removal of\\nthe colon, leaving the rectum or lowest portion of the\\nintestine in place. The small intestine can be attached to\\nthe rectum, allowing normal bowel function. This is often\\ncalled ileorectal anastomosis. Others argue that this sec-\\ntion is also liable to develop polyps, needs to be moni-\\ntored regularly, and may require eventual removal.\\nExcision of the entire lower intestine with preserva-\\ntion of normal bowel function is possible. This entails a\\nmore complex surgical procedure. The patient may expe-\\nrience more complications and a longer recovery period.\\nHowever, the risk of polyp development in this area is\\nvery low. Periodic examination of the intestine may not\\nbe needed once healing is complete.\\nThe more intricate surgery may be referred to as a J-\\npouch procedure, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, a\\nrestorative proctocolectomy, or an ileoanal reservoir proce-\\ndure. It involves creating a “pouch” of tissue from the small\\nintestine, which is attached to the anus. This serves as a\\nreservoir or holding area for stool, much as the rectum does\\nnormally. The surgery is often done in several stages. A\\ntemporary ileostomy, which creates an opening of the small\\nintestines onto the abdomen, is required. When all proce-\\ndures are completed, and after a recuperation period, the\\npatient regains normal bowel function through the anus.\\nSome researchers suggest that as genetic testing\\nbecomes more developed, the specific portion of the\\ngene involved may dictate the type of surgery chosen.\\nThose at high risk of developing rectal polyps may be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1286\\nFamilial polyposis'),\n",

This approach regards the family, as a\\nwhole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac-\\ntors as relationships and communication patterns rather\\nthan traits or symptoms in individual members.\\nFamily therapy is a relatively recent development in\\npsychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, when\\ndoctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients,\\nnoticed that the patients’ families communicated in dis-\\nturbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients’\\nsymptoms rose or fell according to the level of tension\\nbetween their parents. These observations led to consid-\\nering a family as an organism or system with its own\\ninternal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency to\\nresist change. The therapists started to treat the families\\nof schizophrenic patients as whole units rather than\\nfocusing on the hospitalized member. They found that in\\nmany cases the family member with schizophrenia\\nimproved when the “patient” was the family system.\\n(This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo-\\nphrenia is caused by family problems, although family\\nproblems may worsen the condition.) This approach of\\ninvolving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther-\\napy was then applied to families with problems other\\nthan the presence of schizophrenia.\\nFamily therapy is becoming an increasingly com-\\nmon form of treatment as changes in American society\\nare reflected in family structures.

Frey\\nFamine fever see Relapsing fever\\nFanconi’s syndrome\\nDefinition\\nFanconi’s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions\\nbrought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor-\\nders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc-\\ntion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal-\\ncium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the\\nbody. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth.\\nDescription\\nNormally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its\\nsalt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body\\nneeds in the blood and putting what the body doesn’t\\nneed into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is\\nperformed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered\\nthrough a kidney structure with small holes that keep the\\ncells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of\\nthe small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body,\\nare reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream.\\nThis reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi’s syn-\\ndrome. As a consequence, substances that are normally\\nreabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins,\\nwater, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and\\nphosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic.\\nFanconi’s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn-\\ndrome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular\\nsyndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome.\\nFanconi’s anemia is, however, a totally different disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nFanconi’s syndrome can be caused by a variety of\\ngenetic defects and by certain environmental assaults.\\nThe genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan-\\nconi’s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause\\nin children),galactosemia , glycogen storage disease,\\nhereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome,\\nWilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease,\\nvitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan-\\nconi’s syndrome.\\nEnvironmental assaults that cause Fanconi’s syn-\\ndrome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium,\\nlead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like\\noutdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances\\n(like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine\\ntaken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans-\\nplantation.\\nSymptoms\\nFanconi’s syndrome symptoms related directly to\\nimpaired absorption include excessive urine production\\nand urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa-\\ntion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu-\\ncose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and\\nprotein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in\\nthe urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels\\nof phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively\\nacidic blood.\\nThe most noticeable indirect consequences of\\nimpaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and\\nosteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated\\nwith bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty\\nwalking. If a person acquires Fanconi’s syndrome as an\\nadult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is\\naccompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac-\\ntures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases\\ncannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and\\noccasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of\\nthe ineffective reabsorption.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Fanconi’s syndrome can be made by\\nurine and blood tests. It is also important to find the\\nunderlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other\\nsymptoms specific to a particular patient will point to\\nother useful diagnostic tests.

If nine to twelve months of conservative treatment\\n(reducing time on feet, non-steroid anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs, arch supports) under the supervision of a doctor\\ndoes not result in pain relief, a fasciotomy may be done.\\nFasciotomy removes a small portion of the fascia to\\nrelieve tension and pain. Connective tissue grows back\\ninto the cut space left by the cut, effectively lengthening\\nthe fascia.\\nWhen a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of\\nthe body, it is usually done to relieve pressure from a\\ncompression injury to a limb.

It is frequently prescribed as a detoxifica-\\ntion treatment for those with conditions that may be\\ninfluenced by environmental factors, such as cancer and\\nmultiple chemical sensitivity . Fasting has been used\\nsuccessfully to help treat people who have been exposed\\nto high levels of toxic materials due to accident or occu-\\npation. Fasting is thought to be beneficial as a preventa-\\ntive measure to increase overall health, vitality, and resis-\\ntance to disease. Fasting is also used as a method of men-\\ntal and spiritual rejuvenation.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nUsed for thousands of years, fasting is one of the\\noldest therapies in medicine. Many of the great doctors\\nof ancient times and many of the oldest healing systems\\nhave recommended it as an integral method of healing\\nand prevention. Hippocrates, the father of Western medi-\\ncine, believed fasting enabled the body to heal itself.\\nParacelsus, another great healer in the Western tradition,\\nwrote 500 years ago that “fasting is the greatest remedy,\\nthe physician within.”Ayurvedic medicine, the world’s\\noldest healing system, has long advocated fasting as a\\nmajor treatment.\\nFasting has also been used in nearly every religion in\\nthe world, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism,\\nand Islam. Many of history’s great spiritual leaders fasted\\nfor mental and spiritual clarity, including Jesus, Buddha,\\nand Mohammed. In one of the famous political acts of\\nthe last century, the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi fast-\\ned for 21 days to promote peace.\\nFasting has been used in Europe as a medical treat-\\nment for years. Many spas and treatment centers, particu-\\nlarly those in Germany, Sweden, and Russia, use med-\\nically supervised fasting. Fasting has gained popularity\\nin American alternative medicine over the past several\\ndecades, and many doctors feel it is beneficial. Fasting is\\na central therapy in detoxification, a healing method\\nfounded on the principle that the build up of toxic sub-\\nstances in the body is responsible for many illnesses and\\nconditions.\\nThe principle of fasting is simple. When the intake\\nof food is temporarily stopped, many systems of the\\nbody are given a break from the hard work of digestion.\\nThe extra energy gives the body the chance to heal and\\nrestore itself, and burning stored calories gets rid of toxic\\nsubstances stored in the body.\\nThe digestive tract is the part of the body most\\nexposed to environmental threats, including bacteria,\\nviruses, parasites, and toxins. It requires the most\\nimmune system support. When food is broken down in\\nthe intestines, it travels through the blood to the liver, the\\nlargest organ of the body’s natural detoxification system.\\nThe liver breaks down and removes the toxic by-products\\nproduced by digestion, including natural ones and the\\nchemicals now present in the food supply. During fast-\\ning, the liver and immune system are essentially freed to\\ndetoxify and heal other parts of the body.\\nMany healers claim that fasting is a particularly use-\\nful therapy for Americans and for the modern lifestyle,\\nsubjected to heavy diets, overeating, and constant expo-\\nsure to food additives and chemicals. Some alternative\\npractitioners have gone so far as to estimate that the aver-\\nage American is carrying 5-10 pounds of toxic sub-\\nstances in their bodies, for which fasting is the quickest\\nand most effective means of removal.\\nPhysiology of fasting\\nThrough evolution, the body became very efficient\\nat storing energy and handling situations when no food\\nwas available. For many centuries, fasting was probably\\na normal occurrence for most people, and the body\\nadapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin people\\ncan survive for 40 days or more without food. The body\\nhas a special mechanism that is initiated when no food is\\neaten. Fasting is not starvation , but rather the body’s\\nburning of stored energy. Starvation occurs when the\\nbody no longer has any stored energy and begins using\\nessential tissues such as organs for an energy source.\\nTherapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.\\nMany physiological changes occur in the body dur-\\ning fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses its\\nglycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energy\\nsupply. After these are depleted, the body begins using\\nfat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-\\nments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-\\ngen). To obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins to\\nbreak down muscle tissue during the second day of the\\nfast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. To\\nfuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a pound\\nof muscle a day, but the body has developed another way\\nto create energy that saves important muscle mass. This\\nprotein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occurs\\nduring the third day of a fast for men and the second day\\nfor women. In this highly efficient state, the liver begins\\nconverting stored fat and other nonessential tissues into\\nketones, which can be used by the brain, muscles, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1293\\nFasting'),\n",

The goal of most fasts is to allow the\\nbody to reach the ketosis state in order to burn excess fat\\nand unneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer than\\nthree days are generally recommended as therapy.\\nWeight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few\\ndays of a fast, up to 2 pounds per day. In following days,\\nthe figure drops to around 0.5 pound per day. An average\\nweight loss of a pound a day for an entire fast can be\\nexpected.\\nPerforming a fast\\nFasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,\\ndepending on the person and his or her health require-\\nments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommend\\nfrom two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-\\nday fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-\\ning program for prevention and general health is a three-\\nday fast taken four times per year, at the change of each\\nseason. These can be easily performed over long week-\\nends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used by\\nmany people as well.\\nJuice fasts are also used by many people, although\\nthese are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-\\nsive than water fasts because the body doesn’t reach the\\nketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit and\\nvegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutrients.\\nPeople can fit a few days of juice fasting into their normal\\nschedules without significant drops in energy. Juice fasts\\nare also said to have cleansing and detoxifying effects.\\nThe disadvantage of juice fasts is that the body never gets\\nto the ketosis stage, so these fasters are thought to lack the\\ndeep detoxification and healing effects of the water fast.\\nMedical supervision is recommended for any fast\\nover three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,\\nsuch as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedic\\ndoctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.\\nThose performing extended fasts and those with health\\nconditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-\\ning fasting. There are many alternative health clinics that\\nperform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-\\nventional medical doctors may also supervise patients\\nduring fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary, depend-\\ning on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.\\nPreparations\\nFasts must be entered and exited with care. To enter\\na fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a few\\ndays. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy products\\nshould be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts, and\\nbeans should then be reduced for several days. The day\\nbefore a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits, light\\nsalads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast, only\\npure water and occasional herbal teas should be drunk.\\nFasts should be ended as gradually as they are\\nentered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressive-\\nly. The diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, whole-\\nsome foods. Fasters should particularly take care not to\\novereat when they complete a fast.\\nPrecautions\\nFasting isn’t appropriate for everyone and, in some\\ncases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a first\\nfast longer than three days should seek medical supervi-\\nsion. Those with health conditions should always have\\nmedical support during fasting. Plenty of water should be\\ntaken by fasters since dehydration can occur. Saunas and\\nsweating therapies are sometimes recommended to assist\\ndetoxification, but should be used sparingly. Those fasting\\nshould significantly slow down their lifestyles. Taking\\ntime off of work is helpful, or at least reducing the work\\nload. Fasters should also get plenty of rest. Exercise\\nshould be kept light, such as walking and gentle stretching.\\nSide effects\\nThose fasting may experience side effects of\\nfatigue , malaise, aches and pains, emotional duress,\\nacne, headaches, allergies, swelling, vomiting, bad\\nbreath, and symptoms of colds and flu. These reactions\\nare sometimes called healing crises, which are caused by\\ntemporarily increased levels of toxins in the body due to\\nelimination and cleansing. Lower energy levels should be\\nexpected during a fast.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nThe physiology of fasting has been widely studied\\nand documented by medical science. Beneficial effects\\nsuch as lowered cholesterol and improved general func-\\ntioning have been shown. Fasting as a treatment for ill-\\nness and disease has been studied less, although some\\nstudies around the world have shown beneficial results. A\\n1984 study showed that workers in Taiwan who had\\nsevere chemical poisoning had dramatic improvement\\nafter a ten-day fast. In Russia and Japan, studies have\\ndemonstrated fasting to be an effective treatment for men-\\ntal illness. Fasting has been featured on the cover of med-\\nical journals, although mainstream medicine has general-\\nly ignored fasting and detoxification treatments as valid\\nmedical procedures.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1294\\nFasting'),\n",

Fatigue\\ncan also trigger serious mental exhaustion. Persistent\\nfatigue can cause a lack of mental clarity (or feeling of\\nmental “fuzziness”), difficulty concentrating, and in\\nsome cases, memory loss.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFatigue may be the result of one or more environ-\\nmental causes such as inadequate rest, improper diet,\\nwork and home stressors, or poor physical conditioning,\\nor one symptom of a chronic medical condition or dis-\\nease process in the body. Heart disease, low blood pres-\\nsure, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, iron-deficiency\\nanemia,narcolepsy , and cancer can cause long-term,\\nongoing fatigue symptoms. Acute illnesses such as viral\\nand bacterial infections can also trigger temporary feel-\\nings of exhaustion. In addition, mental disorders such as\\ndepression can also cause fatigue.\\nA number of medications, including antihistamines,\\nantibiotics , and blood pressure medications, may cause\\ndrowsiness as a side-effect. Individuals already suffering\\nfrom fatigue who are prescribed one of these medications\\nmay wish to check with their healthcare provider about\\nalternative treatments.\\nExtreme fatigue which persists, unabated, for at least\\nsix months, is not the result of a diagnosed disease or ill-\\nness, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as\\nswollen lymph nodes,sore throat, and muscle weakness\\nand/or pain may indicate a diagnosis of chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (sometimes called\\nchronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome), is a debil-\\nitating illness that causes overwhelming exhaustion and a\\nconstellation of neurological and immunological symp-\\ntoms. Between 1.5 and 2 million Americans are estimat-\\ned to suffer from the disorder.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause fatigue is a symptom of a number of differ-\\nent disorders, diseases, and lifestyle choices, diagnosis\\nmay be difficult. A thorough examination and patient his-\\ntory by a qualified healthcare provider is the first step in\\ndetermining the cause of the fatigue. A physician can\\nrule out physical conditions and diseases that feature\\nfatigue as a symptom, and can also determine if prescrip-\\ntion drugs, poor dietary habits, work environment, or\\nother external stressors could be triggering the exhaus-\\ntion.

Because there is no specific biolog-\\nical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis-\\norder, healthcare providers must rely on the patient’s pre-\\nsentation and severity of symptoms to make a diagnosis.\\nIn many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn-\\ndrome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic tests\\nand several years of consultation with medical profes-\\nsionals before receiving a correct diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nConventional medicine recommends the dietary and\\nlifestyle changes outlined above as a first line of defense\\nagainst fatigue. Individuals who experience occasional\\nfatigue symptoms may benefit from short term use of\\ncaffeine-containing central nervous stimulants, which\\nmake people more alert, less drowsy, and improve coor-\\ndination. However, these should be prescribed with\\nextreme caution, as overuse of the drug can lead to seri-\\nous sleep disorders, like insomnia.\\nAnother reason to avoid extended use of caffeine is\\nits associated withdrawal symptoms. People who use\\nlarge amounts of caffeine over long periods build up a\\ntolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use more\\nand more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeine\\nuse can also lead to dependence. If an individual stops\\nusing caffeine abruptly, withdrawal symptoms may\\noccur, including headache , fatigue, drowsiness, yawn-\\ning, irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose.\\nThese symptoms can go on for as long as a week.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe treatment of fatigue depends on its direct cause,\\nbut there are several commonly prescribed treatments for\\nnon-specific fatigue, including dietary and lifestyle\\nchanges, the use of essential oils and herbal therapies,\\ndeep breathing exercises,traditional Chinese medicine,\\nand color therapy.\\nDietary changes\\nInadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can\\ncause fatigue symptoms. To maintain an adequate energy\\nsupply and promote overall physical well-being, individ-\\nuals should eat a balanced diet and observe the following\\nnutritional guidelines:\\n• Drink plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink 9\\nto 12 glasses of water a day. Dehydration can reduce\\nblood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue.\\n• Eat iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri-\\ncots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygen\\nthroughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin-\\nished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue.\\n• Avoid high-fat meals and snacks. High fat foods take\\nlonger to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain, heart,\\nand rest of the body while blood flow is increased to the\\nstomach.\\n• Eat unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together for\\nsustained energy.\\n• Balance proteins. Limiting protein to 15–20 grams per\\nmeal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended, but\\nnot getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant or\\nbreastfeeding women should get more protein.\\n• Get the recommended daily allowance of B complex\\nvitamins (specifically, pantothenic acid, folic acid, thi-\\namine, and vitamin B12). Deficiencies in these vitamins\\ncan trigger fatigue.\\n• Get the recommended daily allowance of selenium,\\nriboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritional\\nelements in metabolizing food energy.\\n• Control portions. Individuals should only eat when\\nthey’re hungry, and stop when they’re full. An over-\\nstuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi-\\nviduals who are overweight are much more likely to\\nregularly experience fatigue symptoms.\\nLifestyle changes\\nLifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic work\\nhours, lack of social or family support, or erratic sleep pat-\\nterns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is an issue, a\\nnumber of relaxation therapies and techniques are available\\nto help alleviate tension, including massage,yoga, aro-\\nmatherapy, hydrotherapy, progressive relaxation exercis-\\nes, meditation, and guided imagery. Some individuals\\nmay also benefit from individual or family counseling or\\npsychotherapy sessions to work through stress-related\\nfatigue that is a result of family or social issues.\\nMaintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to prop-\\ner rest. Having a set “bedtime” helps to keep sleep on\\nschedule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is also\\nimportant to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom should\\nbe quiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and with\\nadequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street-\\nlights out.

The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses\\nacupunctureand/or herbal therapy to rebalance the\\nentire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurum\\nsoup (or Xiao Chia Hu Tang) has been used for nearly\\n2,000 years for the type of chronic fatigue that comes\\nafter the flu. In this condition, the person has low-grade\\nfever, nausea, and fatigue. There are other formulas that\\nare helpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves the\\nplacement of a series of thin needles into the skin at tar-\\ngeted locations on the body known as acupoints in order\\nto harmonize the energy flow within the human body.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAromatherapy —The therapeutic use of plant-\\nderived, aromatic essential oils to promote physi-\\ncal and psychological well-being.\\nGuided imagery—The use of relaxation and men-\\ntal visualization to improve mood and/or physical\\nwell-being.\\nHydrotherapy—Hydrotherapy, or water therapy, is\\nuse of water (hot, cold, steam, or ice) to relieve\\ndiscomfort and promote physical well-being.\\nDeep breathing exercises\\nIndividuals under stress often experience fast, shal-\\nlow breathing.

The individual takes a series\\nof long, deep breaths through the nose, attempting to raise\\nthe abdomen instead of the chest. Air is exhaled through\\nthe relaxed mouth. Deep breathing can be continued for up\\nto 20 minutes. After the exerciseis complete, the individual\\nchecks again for body tension and relaxation.

Left untreated, it can\\ncontribute to other illnesses. It is usually reversible once\\nthe cause of the problem is diagnosed and corrected. The\\nliver is the organ responsible for changing fats eaten in\\nthe diet to types of fat that can be stored and used by the\\nbody. Triglycerides are one of the forms of fat stored by\\nthe body and used for energy and new cell formation. The\\nbreak down of fats in the liver can be disrupted by alco-\\nholism, malnutrition, pregnancy, or poisoning. In fatty\\nliver, large droplets of fat, containing mostly triglycerides,\\ncollect within cells of the liver. The condition is generally\\nnot painful and may go unnoticed for a long period of\\ntime. In severe cases, the liver can increase to over three\\ntimes its normal size and may be painful and tender.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of fatty liver in the United\\nStates is alcoholism. In alcoholic fatty liver, over con-\\nsumption of alcohol changes the way that the liver breaks\\ndown and stores fats. Often, people with chronic alco-\\nholism also suffer from malnutrition by eating irregularly\\nand not consuming a balanced diet. Conditions that can\\nalso cause fatty liver are other forms of malnutrition\\n(especially when there is not enough protein in the diet),\\nobesity, diabetes mellitus , and Reye’s syndrome in\\nchildren. Pregnancy can cause a rare, but serious form of\\nfatty liver that starts late in pregnancy and may be associ-\\nated with jaundice and liver failure. Some drug overdos-\\nes or toxic chemical poisonings, such as carbon tetra-\\nchloride, can also cause fatty liver.\\nOften, there are no symptoms associated with fatty\\nliver.

Symptoms that occur less\\noften in alcoholic fatty liver, but more often in pregnancy\\nrelated fatty liver, are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,\\nand abdominal pain.\\nDiagnosis\\nDuring a physical examination, a doctor might notice\\nthat the liver is enlarged and tender when the abdomen is\\npalpated (examined with the tips of the fingers while the\\npatient lies flat). Blood tests may be used to determine if\\nthe liver is functioning properly. A liver biopsy, where a\\nsmall sample of liver tissue is removed with a long needle\\nor though a very small incision, can be used to confirm\\nfatty liver. In pregnant women, the fatty liver condition is\\nusually associated with another serious complication, pre-\\neclampsia or eclampsia. In this condition, the mother has\\nseriously high blood pressure, swelling, and possibly,\\nseizures. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations of\\nthe SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) and\\nSGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase). In many\\ncases the alkaline phosphatase will be significantly elevat-\\ned due to cholestasisproduced by the fatty infiltration.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment involves correcting the condition that\\ncaused fatty liver and providing supportive care. In fatty\\nliver caused by alcoholism, the treatment is to give up\\ndrinking alcohol and to eat a healthy, well balanced diet.\\nIn fatty liver associated with pregnancy, the recommend-\\ned treatment is to deliver the baby, if the pregnancy is far\\nenough along. Vitamin and mineral supplements along\\nwith nutritional support may be useful.\\nPrognosis\\nFatty liver is usually reversible if recognized and\\ntreated. There may be some long-term tendency toward\\nother types of liver problems depending on how long and\\nhow severe the fatty liver condition was. In pregnant\\nwomen with the condition, the situation can be life\\nthreatening for both the mother and the infant. Left\\nuntreated, there is a high risk of death for both the moth-\\ner and baby. Severe liver damage that may require a liver\\ntransplant can occur in the mother if the condition is not\\nrecognized early.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention consists of maintaining a well balanced diet\\nand healthy lifestyle with moderate or no alcohol consump-\\ntion.

In many cases, childbirth results in damage\\nto the anal sphincter, which is the ring of muscle that\\ncloses the anus and keeps stools within the rectum until a\\nperson can find an appropriate opportunity to defecate.\\nNerve injuries during childbirth may also be a factor in\\nsome cases. An ultrasound study of first-time mothers\\nfound sphincter injuries in 35%. About one-third of the\\ninjured women developed fecal incontinence or an\\nuncontrollable and powerful urge to defecate (urgency)\\nwithin six weeks of giving birth. Childbirth-related\\nincontinence is usually restricted to gas, but for some\\nwomen involves the passing of liquid or solid stools.\\nThe removal of hemorrhoids by surgery or other\\ntechniques (hemorrhoidectomies) can also cause anal\\ndamage and fecal incontinence, as can more complex\\noperations affecting the anus and surrounding areas. Anal\\nand rectal infections as well as Crohn’s disease can lead\\nto incontinence by damaging the muscles that control\\ndefecation. For some people, incontinence becomes a\\nproblem when the anal muscles begin to weaken in\\nmidlife or old age.\\nDementia, mental retardation, strokes, brain tumors,\\nmultiple sclerosis, and other conditions that affect the ner-\\nvous system can cause fecal incontinence by interfering\\nwith muscle function or the normal rectal sensations that\\ntrigger sphincter c ontraction and are necessary for\\nbowel control. One study of multiple sclerosis patients\\ndiscovered that about half were incontinent. Nerve\\ndamage caused by long-lasting diabetes mellitus (dia-\\nbetic neuropathy ) is another condition that can give\\nrise to incontinence.\\nDiagnosis\\nMedical assessments in cases of fecal incontinence\\ntypically involve three steps: asking questions about the\\npatient’s past and current health (the medical history); a\\nphysical examinationof the anal region; and testing for\\nobjective information regarding anal and rectal function.\\nPatient history\\nThe medical history relies on questions that allow\\nthe doctor to evaluate the nature and severity of the\\nproblem and its effect on the patient’s life. The doctor\\nasks, for instance, how long the patient has been suf-\\nfering from incontinence; how often and under what\\ncircumstances incontinence occurs; whether the patient\\nhas any control over defecation; and whether the\\npatient has obstacles to defecation in his or her every-\\nday surroundings, such as a toilet that can be reached\\nonly by climbing a long flight of stairs. For women\\nwho have given birth, a detailed obstetric history is\\nalso necessary.\\nPhysical examination\\nThe physical examination begins with a visual\\ninspection of the anus and the area lying between the\\nanus and the genitals (the perineum) for hemorrhoids,\\ninfections, and other conditions that might explain the\\npatient’s difficulties. During this phase of the examina-\\ntion the doctor asks the patient to bear down. Bearing\\ndown enables the doctor to check whether rectal pro-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1300\\nFecal incontinence'),\n",

Rectal prolapse\\nmeans that the patient’s rectum has been weakened and\\ndrops down through the anus. Next, the doctor uses a pin\\nor probe to stroke the perianal skin. Normally this touch-\\ning causes the anal sphincter to contract and the anus to\\npucker; if it does not, nerve damage may be present. The\\nfinal phase of the examination requires the doctor to\\nexamine internal structures by carefully inserting a\\ngloved and lubricated finger into the anal canal. This\\nallows the doctor to judge the strength of the anal sphinc-\\nter and a key muscle (the puborectalis muscle) in main-\\ntaining continence; to look for abnormalities such as\\nscars and rectal masses; and to learn many other things\\nabout the patient’s medical situation. At this point the\\ndoctor performs the anal wink test again and asks the\\npatient to squeeze and bear down.\\nLaboratory tests\\nInformation from the medical history and physical\\nexamination usually needs to be supplemented by tests\\nthat provide objective measurements of anal and rectal\\nfunction. Anorectal manometry, a common procedure,\\ninvolves inserting a small tube (catheter) or balloon\\ndevice into the anal canal or rectum. Manometry mea-\\nsures, among other things, pressure levels in the anal\\ncanal, rectal sensation, and anal and rectal reflexes. Tests\\nare also available for assessing nerve damage. An anal\\nultrasound probe can supply accurate images of the anal\\nsphincter and reveal whether injury has occurred. Mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging, which requires the insertion of\\na coil into the anal canal, is useful at times.\\nTreatment\\nFecal incontinence arising from an underlying con-\\ndition such as diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be\\nhelped by treating the underlying condition. When that\\ndoes not work, or no underlying condition can be discov-\\nered, one approach is to have the patient use a supposito-\\nry or enema to stimulate defecation at the same time\\nevery day or every other day. The goal is to restore regu-\\nlar bowel habits and keep the bowels free of stools. Med-\\nications such as loperamide (Imodium) and codeine\\nphosphate are often effective in halting incontinence, but\\nonly in less severe cases involving liquid stools or\\nurgency. Dietary changes and exercises done at home to\\nstrengthen the anal muscles may also help.\\nGood results have been reported for biofeedback\\ntraining, although the subject has not been properly\\nresearched. In successful cases, patients regain complete\\ncontrol over defecation, or at least improve their control,\\nby learning to contract the external part of the anal\\nsphincter whenever stools enter the rectum.

It is used to detect micro-\\nscopic blood in the stool and is a screening tool for col-\\norectal cancer.\\nPurpose\\nFOBT uses chemical indicators on stool samples to\\ndetect the presence of blood not otherwise visible. (The\\nword “occult” in the test’s name means that the blood is\\nhidden from view.) Blood originating from or passing\\nthrough the gastrointestinal tract can signal many condi-\\ntions requiring further diagnostic procedures and, possi-\\nbly, medical intervention. These conditions may be\\nbenign or malignant and some of them include:\\n• colorectal and gastric cancers\\n• ulcers\\n• hemorrhoids\\n• polyps\\n• inflammatory bowel disease\\n• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused\\nby medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\\ntory drugs, also called NSAIDs)\\n• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused\\nby stomach acid disorders, such as reflux esophagitis\\nThe FOBT is used routinely (in conjunction with a\\nrectal examination performed by a physician) to screen\\nfor colorectal cancer, particularly after age 50. The order-\\ning of this test should not be taken as an indication that\\ncancer is suspected. The FOBT must be combined with\\nregular screening endoscopy (such as a sigmoidoscopy)\\nto detect cancers at an early stage.\\nPrecautions\\nCertain foods and medicines can influence the test\\nresults. Some fruits contain chemicals that prevent the\\nguaiac, the chemical in which the test paper is soaked,\\nfrom reacting with the blood. Aspirin and some NSAIDs\\nirritate the stomach, resulting in bleeding and should be\\navoided prior to the examination, along with red meat\\nand many vegetables and fruits containing vitamin C. All\\nof these factors could result in a false-positive test.\\nDescription\\nFeces for the stool samples is obtained either by the\\nphysician at the rectal examination or by the patient at\\nhome, using a small spatula or a collection device. In\\nmost cases, the collection of stool samples can easily be\\ndone at home, using a kit supplied by the physician.

The sample is placed in a special enve-\\nlope and either mailed or brought in for analysis. When\\nthe physician applies hydrogen peroxide to the back of\\nthe sample, the paper will turn blue if an abnormal\\namount of blood is present.\\nTypes of fecal occult blood tests\\nHemoccult is one type of fecal occult blood test, and\\nit is the most commonly used. The Hemoccult test takes\\nless than five minutes to perform and may be performed\\nin the physician’s office or in the laboratory. The Hemoc-\\ncult blood test can detect bleeding from the colon as low\\nas 0.5 mg per day.\\nTests that use anti-hemoglobin antibodies (or\\nimmunochemical tests) to detect blood in the stool are\\nalso used. Immunochemical tests can detect up to 0.7 mg\\nof hemoglobin in the stool and do not require dietary\\nrestrictions. Immunochemical tests\\n• are not accurate for screening for stomach cancer\\n• are more sensitive than Hemoccult tests in detecting\\ncolorectal cancer\\n• are more expensive than Hemoccult tests\\nHemoquant, another fecal occult blood test, is used\\nto detect as much as 500 mg/g of blood in the stool. Like\\nthe Hemoccult, the Hemoquant test is affected by red\\nmeat. It is not affected by chemicals in vegetables.\\nFecal blood may also be measured by measuring the\\nchromium in the red blood cells in the feces. The stool is\\ncollected for three to ten days. The test is used in cases\\nwhere the exact amount of the blood loss is required and\\nit is the only test that can exclude blood loss from the\\ngastrointestines with accuracy.\\nPreparation\\nFor 72 hours prior to collecting samples, patients\\nshould avoid red meats, NSAIDs (including aspirin),\\nantacids, steroids, iron supplements, and vitamin C,\\nincluding citrus fruits and other foods containing large\\namounts of vitamin C. Foods like uncooked broccoli,\\nuncooked turnips, cauliflower, uncooked cantaloupe,\\nuncooked radish and horseradish and parsnips should be\\navoided and not eaten during the 72 hours prior to the\\nexamination. Fish, chicken, pork, fruits (other than mel-\\nons) and many cooked vegetables are permitted in the diet.\\nResults\\nMany factors can result in false-positive and false-\\nnegative findings.\\nKEY TERMS\\nOccult—Not visible or easily detected.\\nPositive results\\nIt is important to note that a true-positive finding\\nonly signifies the presence of blood—it is not an indica-\\ntion of cancer. The National Cancer Institute states that,\\nin its experience, less than 10% of all positive results\\nwere caused by cancer. The FOBT is positive in 1–5% of\\nthe unscreened population and 2–10% of those are found\\nto have cancer. The physician will want to follow up on a\\npositive result with further tests, as indicated by other\\nfactors in the patient’s history or condition.\\nNegative results\\nAlternatively, a negative result (meaning no blood\\nwas detected) does not guarantee the absence of colon\\ncancer, which may bleed only occasionally or not at all.\\n(Only 50% of colon cancers are FOBT-positive.)\\nConclusions\\nScreening using the FOBT has been demonstrated to\\nreduce colorectal cancer. However, because only half of\\ncolorectal cancers are FOBT-positive, FOBT must be\\ncombined with regular screening endoscopy to increase\\nthe detection of pre-malignant colorectal polyps and can-\\ncers.

Its goal is to re-educate the\\nnervous system and improve motor ability. The system\\ncan accomplish much more, relieving pressure on joints\\nand weak points, and allowing the body to heal repeti-\\ntive strain injuries. Continued use of the method can\\nrelieve pain and lead to higher standards of achieve-\\nment in sports, the martial arts, dancing and other phys-\\nical disciplines.\\nPupils are taught to become aware of their move-\\nments and to become aware of how they use their bodies,\\nthus discovering possible areas of stress and strain. The\\ngoal of Feldenkrais is to take the individual from merely\\nfunctioning, to functioning well, free of pain and restric-\\ntion of movement. Feldenkrais himself stated that his\\ngoal was, “To make the impossible possible, the possible\\neasy, and the easy, elegant.”\\nPurpose\\nThis method of re-educating the nervous system\\ncan be beneficial to a wide range of people, including\\nathletes, children, the elderly, martial artists, those who\\nare handicapped, people with special needs, and those\\nsuffering from degenerative diseases. It has also\\nproved popular with artists, particularly musicians, a\\nnumber of whom have used Feldenkrais to improve\\ntheir performance.\\nThe Feldenkrais Guild of North America (FGNA)\\nstates that over half of the those who turn to Feldenkrais\\npractitioners are seeking relief from pain. Many people\\nwho have pain from an injury compensate by changing\\ntheir movements to limit pain. Often these changed\\nmovements remain after the pain from the original\\ninjury is gone, and new pain may occur. Feldenkrais\\nhelps students become aware of the changed movements\\nand allows them to learn new movements that relieve\\ntheir pain. Apart from the obvious physical benefits of\\nmore efficient movement and freedom from pain and\\nrestriction, Feldenkrais practitioners assert that there are\\nother positive benefits for overall physical and mental\\nhealth. Feldenkrais can result in increased awareness,\\nflexibility, and coordination, and better relaxation.\\nFeldenkrais practitioners have also noted other benefits\\nin their students, including improvements in awareness,\\nflexibility, coordination, breathing, digestion, sleep,\\nmood, mental alertness, energy, and range of motion, as\\nwell as reduced stress and hypertension , and fewer\\nheadaches and backaches.\\nMusicians and athletes can improve their perfor-\\nmance in many ways when they learn to use their bodies\\nmore efficiently. Feldenkrais can also help injured ath-\\nletes regain lost potential and free them from pain and\\nrestriction of movement.\\nThere are numerous accounts of the remarkable\\nresults obtained when Feldenkrais is taught to handi-\\ncapped children so that they can learn to function despite\\ntheir limitations. Handicapped people can learn to make\\nfull use of whatever potential they have, and to have\\nmore confidence in their abilities. Practitioners who spe-\\ncialize in teaching Feldenkrais to those who have handi-\\ncaps have in many cases allowed the patient to discover\\nways of performing tasks which were previously thought\\nto be impossible for them.\\nThe elderly, whose movements are often restricted\\nby pain and stiffness, can learn to overcome these obsta-\\ncles with Feldenkrais instruction. In some instances even\\nsevere cases of arthritis have been conquered. Theoreti-\\ncally, Feldenkrais can make possible renewed levels of\\nenergy and freedom from restriction.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nMoshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984) was a Russian-\\nborn Israeli physicist and engineer who was also an\\nactive soccer player and judo master. He devised his\\nsystem in response to his own recurring knee injury,\\nwhich had restricted his movement and caused him\\ngreat pain over a long period of time. Feldenkrais\\nbelieved that repeated muscle patterns cause the parts\\nof the brain controlling those muscles to stay in a fixed\\npattern as well. He thought that the more the muscles\\nare used, the more parts of the brain can be activated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1304\\nFeldenkrais method'),\n",

The practitioner helps the pupil by guid-\\ning him or her through a number of movements. The\\npractitioner may use touch to communicate with the\\nstudent, but touch is not used to correct any move-\\nments. The purpose of this session is to increase a stu-\\ndent’s awareness of his or her own movement and\\nbecome open to different possibilities for movement.\\nThe instruction can be focused on a particular activity\\nthat the student does every day, or that causes him or\\nher pain.

It is also called female circumcision.\\nPurpose\\nFGM results in the cutting or removal of the tissues\\naround the vagina that give women pleasurable sexual\\nfeelings. This procedure is used for social and cultural\\ncontrol of women’s sexuality. In its most extreme form,\\ninfibulation, where the girl’s vagina is sewn shut, the pro-\\ncedure ensures virginity. In some cultures where female\\ncircumcision has been a tradition for hundreds of years,\\nthis procedure is considered a rite of passage for young\\ngirls. Families fear that if their daughters are left uncir-\\ncumcised, they may not be marriageable. As in most cul-\\ntures, there is also the fear that the girl might bring\\nshame to the family by being sexually active and becom-\\ning pregnant before marriage.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is illegal to perform FGM in many countries,\\nincluding the United States, Canada, France, Great\\nBritain, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Kenya, and Sene-\\ngal. This procedure is usually done in the home or some-\\nwhere other than a medical setting. Often, it is performed\\nby a family member or by a local “circumciser,” using\\nknives, razor blades, or other tools that may not be steril-\\nized before use.\\nDescription\\nFemale circumcision includes a wide range of pro-\\ncedures. The simplest form involves a small cut to the\\nclitoris or labial tissue. A Sunna circumcision removes\\nthe prepuce (a fold of skin that covers the clitoris) and/or\\nthe tip of the clitoris. A clitoridectomy removes the entire\\nclitoris and some or all of the surrounding tissue; this\\nprocedure occurs in approximately 80% of cases. The\\nmost extreme form of genital mutilation is excision and\\ninfibulation, in which the clitoris and all of the surround\\ntissue are cut away and the remaining skin is sewn\\ntogether. Only a small opening is left for the passage of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21306\\nFemale genital mutilation'),\n",

As more people move to Western countries from\\ncountries where female circumcision is performed, the\\npractice has come to the attention of health professionals\\nin the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia.\\nIn an effort to integrate old customs with modern\\nmedical care, some immigrant families have requested\\nthat physicians perform the procedure. While trying to\\nbe sensitive to cultural traditions, health care\\nproviders are sometimes put in the difficult position of\\nchoosing to perform this procedure in a medical facili-\\nty under sanitary conditions, or refusing the request,\\nknowing that it may be done anyway with no medical\\nsupervision. Some families who are intent on having\\nthis procedure done will take their daughters back to\\nthe country they immigrated from in order to have the\\ngirls circumcised.\\nMany national and international medical organiza-\\ntions including the American Medical Association\\n(AMA), Canadian medical organizations, and WHO\\noppose the practice of female genital mutilation. The\\nUnited Nations (UN) considers female genital mutilation\\na violation of human rights. WHO has undertaken a num-\\nber of projects aimed at decreasing the incidence of\\nFGM.

It is also called\\n“frigidity.” Other terms for the disorder include dyspareu-\\nnia and vaginismus, both of which involve pain during\\nintercourse.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are numerous causes of this disorder. They\\ninclude:\\n• physical problems, such as endometriosis , cystitis,o r\\nvaginitis\\n• systemic problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure,\\nor hypothyroidism. Even pregnancy or the postpartum\\nperiod (time after delivery of a child) may affect desire.\\nMenopauseis also known to reduce sexual desire.\\n• medications, including oral contraceptives , anti-\\ndepressants, antihypertensives, and tranquilizers\\n• surgery, such as mastectomy or hysterectomy which\\nmay affect how a woman feels about her sexual self.\\n• stress\\n• depression\\n• use of alcohol, drugs, or cigarette smoking\\nSymptoms vary. A woman may have no desire for\\nsex, or may not be able to maintain arousal, or may be\\nunable to reach orgasm. She may also have pain during\\nsex or orgasm, which interferes with her desire for inter-\\ncourse.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo make a diagnosis, a woman’s physician - either\\nfamily doctor, gynecologist, or even urologist — takes a\\ncomplete medical history to determine when the problem\\nstarted, how it presents, how severe it is, and what the\\npatient thinks may be causing it. The doctor will also\\nconduct a complete physical examination , looking for\\nany abnormalities in the genital region\\nTreatment\\nThe physician should start by providing education\\nabout the disorder and recommending various non-med-\\nical treatment strategies. These include:\\n• use of erotic materials, such as vibrators, books, maga-\\nzines and videos\\n• sensual massage, avoiding the genitals\\n• position changes to reduce pain\\n• use of lubricants to moisten the vagina and genital area\\n• kegel exercises to strengthen the vagina and clitoris\\n• therapy to overcome any relationship or sexual abuse\\nissues\\nMedical treatments include:\\n• estrogen replacement therapy, which may help with\\nvaginal dryness, pain and arousal\\n• testosterone therapy in women who have low levels of\\nthis male hormone (side effects, however, may include\\ndeepening voice, hair growth, and acne)\\n• the EROS clitoral therapy device (EROS-CTD), recent-\\nly approved by the Food and Drug Administration; a\\nsmall vacuum pump, placed over the clitoris and gently\\nactivated to provide a gentle suction designed to\\nincrease blood flow to the region, which, in turn, helps\\nwith arousal\\n• using the herb yohimbine combined with nitric oxide\\nhas been found to increase vaginal blood flow in post-\\nmenopausal women and thus help with some forms of\\nFSAD\\nAlternative treatment\\nNatural estrogens, such as those found in soy prod-\\nucts and flax, may be effective.

This condition was first recognized and\\nreported in the medical literature in 1968 in France and in\\n1973 in the United States. Alcohol is a teratogen, the term\\nused for any drug, chemical, maternal disease or other\\nenvironmental exposure that can cause birth defects or\\nfunctional impairment in a developing fetus. Some fea-\\ntures may be present at birth including low birth weight,\\nprematurity, and microcephaly. Characteristic facial fea-\\ntures may be present at birth, or may become more obvi-\\nous over time. Signs of brain damage include delays in\\ndevelopment, behavioral abnormalities, and mental retar-\\ndation, but affected individuals exhibit a wide range of\\nabilities and disabilities. It has only been since 1991 that\\nthe long-term outcome of FAS has been known. Learning,\\nbehavioral, and emotional problems are common in ado-\\nlescents and adults with FAS. Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE),\\na term no longer favored, is sometimes used to describe\\nindividuals with some, but not all, of the features of FAS.\\nIn 1996, the Institute of Medicine suggested a five-level\\nsystem to describe the birth defects, learning and behav-\\nioral difficulties in offspring of women who drank alcohol\\nduring pregnancy. This system contains criteria including\\nconfirmation of maternal alcohol exposure, characteristic\\nfacial features, growth problems, learning and behavioral\\nproblems, and birth defects known to be associated with\\nprenatal alcohol exposure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1309\\nFetal alcohol syndrome'),\n",

However, a recent study\\nreported in 1997, utilizing the Institute of Medicine crite-\\nria, estimated the prevalence in Seattle, Washington from\\n1975–1981 at nearly one in 100 live births. Avoiding\\nalcohol during pregnancy, including the earliest weeks of\\nthe pregnancy can prevent FAS. There is no amount of\\nalcohol use during pregnancy that has been proven to be\\ncompletely safe.\\nThere is no racial or ethnic predilection for FAS.\\nIndividuals from different genetic backgrounds exposed\\nto similar amounts of alcohol during pregnancy may\\nexhibit different signs or symptoms of FAS. Several stud-\\nies have estimated that between 25–45% of chronic alco-\\nholic women will give birth to a child with FAS if they\\ncontinue to drink during pregnancy. The risk of FAS\\nappears to increase as a chronic alcoholic woman pro-\\ngresses in her childbearing years and continues to drink.\\nThat is, a child with FAS will often be one of the last\\nborn to a chronic alcoholic woman, although older sib-\\nlings may exhibit milder features of FAS. Binge drink-\\ning, defined as sporadic use of five or more standard\\nalcoholic drinks per occasion, and “moderate” daily\\ndrinking (two to four 12 oz bottles of beer, eight to 16\\nounces of wine, two to four ounces of liquor) can also\\nresult in offspring with features of FAS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFAS is not a genetic or inherited disorder. It is a pat-\\ntern of birth defects, learning, and behavioral problems\\nthat are the result of maternal alcohol use during the\\npregnancy. The alcohol freely crosses the placenta and\\ncauses damage to the developing embryo or fetus. Alco-\\nhol use by the father cannot cause FAS. If a woman who\\nhas FAS drinks alcohol during pregnancy, then she may\\nalso have a child with FAS. Not all individuals from\\nalcohol exposed pregnancies have obvious signs or\\nsymptoms of FAS; individuals of different genetic back-\\ngrounds may be more or less susceptible to the damage\\nthat alcohol can cause. The dose of alcohol, the time dur-\\ning pregnancy that alcohol is used, and the pattern of\\nalcohol use all contribute to the different signs and symp-\\ntoms that are found.\\nClassic features of FAS include short stature, low\\nbirthweight and poor weight gain, microcephaly, and a\\ncharacteristic pattern of facial features. These facial fea-\\ntures in infants and children may include small eye open-\\nings (measured from inner corner to outer corner), epican-\\nthal folds (folds of tissue at the inner corner of the eye),\\nsmall or short nose, low or flat nasal bridge, smooth or\\npoorly developed philtrum (the area of the upper lip above\\nthe colored part of the lip and below the nose), thin upper\\nlip, and small chin. Some of these features are nonspecific,\\nmeaning they can occur in other conditions, or be appro-\\npriate for age, racial, or family background. Other major\\nand minor birth defects that have been reported include\\ncleft palate, congenital heart defects,strabismus, hearing\\nloss, defects of the spine and joints, alteration of the hand\\ncreases, small fingernails, and toenails. Since FAS was\\nfirst described in infants and children, the diagnosis is\\nsometimes more difficult to recognize in older adolescents\\nand adults. Short stature and microcephaly remain com-\\nmon features, but weight may normalize, and the individ-\\nual may actually become overweight for his/her height.\\nThe chin and nose grow proportionately more than the\\nmiddle part of the face and dental crowding may become a\\nproblem. The small eye openings and the appearance of\\nthe upper lip and philtrum may continue to be characteris-\\ntic. Pubertal changes typically occur at the normal time.\\nNewborns with FAS may have difficulties with feed-\\ning due to a poor suck, have irregular sleep-wake cycles,\\ndecreased or increased muscle tone, seizures or tremors.\\nDelays in achieving developmental milestones such as\\nrolling over, crawling, walking and talking may become\\napparent in infancy. Behavior and learning difficulties typ-\\nical in the preschool or early school years include poor\\nattention span, hyperactivity, poor motor skills, and slow\\nlanguage development. Attention deficit-hyperactivity dis-\\norder is a common associated diagnosis. Learning disabili-\\nties or mental retardation may be diagnosed during this\\ntime. Arithmetic is often the most difficult subject for a\\nchild with FAS. During middle school and high school\\nyears the behavioral difficulties and learning difficulties\\ncan be significant. Memory problems, poor judgment, dif-\\nficulties with daily living skills, difficulties with abstract\\nreasoning skills, and poor social skills are often apparent\\nby this time. It is important to note that animal and human\\nstudies have shown that neurologic and behavioral abnor-\\nmalities can be present without characteristic facial fea-\\ntures. These individuals may not be identified as having\\nFAS, but may fulfill criteria for alcohol- related diagnoses,\\nas set forth by the Institute of Medicine.\\nIn 1991, Streissguth and others reported some of the\\nfirst long-term follow-up studies of adolescents and\\nadults with FAS. In the approximate 60 individuals they\\nstudied, the average IQ was 68, with 70 being the lower\\nlimit of the normal range. However, the range of IQ was\\nquite large, as low as 20 (severely retarded) to as high as\\n105 (normal). The average achievement levels for read-\\ning, spelling, and arithmetic were fourth grade, third\\ngrade and second grade, respectively.

Daily living skills were at a level of nine years,\\nand social skills were at the level of a six-year-old.\\nIn 1996, Streissguth and others published further data\\nregarding the disabilities in children, adolescents and\\nadults with FAS. Secondary disabilities, that is, those dis-\\nabilities not present at birth and that might be preventable\\nwith proper diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, were\\ndescribed. These secondary disabilities include: mental\\nhealth problems; disrupted school experiences; trouble\\nwith the law; incarceration for mental health problems,\\ndrug abuse, or a crime; inappropriate sexual behavior;\\nalcohol and drug abuse; problems with employment;\\ndependent living; and difficulties parenting their own chil-\\ndren. In that study, only seven out of 90 adults were living\\nand working independently and successfully. In addition\\nto the studies by Streissguth, several other authors in dif-\\nferent countries have now reported on long term outcome\\nof individuals diagnosed with FAS. In general, the neuro-\\nlogic, behavioral and emotional disorders become the\\nmost problematic for the individuals. The physical features\\nchange over time, sometimes making the correct diagnosis\\nmore difficult in older individuals, without old pho-\\ntographs and other historical data to review. Mental health\\nproblems including attention deficit, depression, panic\\nattacks,psychosis and suicide threats and attempts, and\\noverall were present in over 90% of the individuals studied\\nby Streissguth. A 1996 study in Germany reported more\\nthan 70% of the adolescents they studied had persistent\\nand severe developmental disabilities and many had psy-\\nchiatric disorders, the most common of which were emo-\\ntional disorders, repetitive habits,speech disorders, and\\nhyperactivity disorders.\\nDiagnosis\\nFAS is a clinical diagnosis, which means that there\\nis no blood, x ray or psychological test that can be per-\\nformed to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The diagno-\\nsis is made based on the history of maternal alcohol use,\\nand detailed physical examination for the characteristic\\nmajor and minor birth defects and characteristic facial\\nfeatures. It is often helpful to examine siblings and par-\\nents of an individual suspected of having FAS, either in\\nperson or by photographs, to determine whether findings\\non the examination might be familial, of if other siblings\\nmay also be affected. Sometimes, genetic tests are per-\\nformed to rule out other conditions that may present with\\ndevelopmental delay or birth defects. Individuals with\\ndevelopmental delay, birth defects or other unusual fea-\\ntures are often referred to a clinical geneticist, develop-\\nmental pediatrician, or neurologist for evaluation and\\ndiagnosis of FAS. Psychoeducational testing to deter-\\nmine IQ and/or the presence of learning disabilities may\\nalso be part of the evaluation process.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCleft palate—A congenital malformation in which\\nthere is an abnormal opening in the roof of the\\nmouth that allows the nasal passages and the\\nmouth to be improperly connected.\\nCongenital—Refers to a disorder which is present\\nat birth.\\nIQ—Abbreviation for Intelligence Quotient.

Most of\\nthe birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol expo-\\nsure are correctable with surgery. Children should have\\npsychoeducational evaluation to help plan appropriate\\neducational interventions.

The fetal hemoglobin\\nthen rapidly decreases to 2% or less after the second to\\nfourth years. By the time of adulthood, only traces (0.5%\\nor less) are found in the bloodstream.\\nIn some diseases associated with abnormal hemo-\\nglobin production (see Hemoglobinopathy, below), fetal\\nhemoglobin may persist in larger amounts.

A\\nstrokeor tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing\\nthe body’s thermostat to malfunction.

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, inher-\\nited condition in which a person develops a very high\\nfever when given certain anesthetics or muscle relaxants\\nin preparation for surgery.\\nHow long a fever lasts and how high it may go\\ndepends on several factors, including its cause, the age of\\nthe patient, and his or her overall health. Most fevers\\ncaused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and\\nthen dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-\\ntious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall\\nthroughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after-\\nnoon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for\\nseveral weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases\\nsuch as lupus or with some cancers, particularly\\nleukemia and lymphoma.\\nDiagnosis\\nA fever is usually diagnosed using a thermometer. A\\nvariety of different thermometers are available, including\\ntraditional glass and mercury ones used for oral or rectal\\ntemperature readings and more sophisticated electronic\\nones that can be inserted in the ear to quickly register the\\nbody’s temperature. For adults and older children, temper-\\nature readings are usually taken orally. Younger children\\nwho cannot or will not hold a thermometer in their mouths\\ncan have their temperature taken by placing an oral ther-\\nmometer under their armpit. Infants generally have their\\ntemperature taken rectally using a rectal thermometer.\\nAs important as registering a patient’s temperature is\\ndetermining the underlying cause of the fever. The pres-\\nence or absence of accompanying symptoms, a patient’s\\nmedical history, and information about what he or she\\nmay have ingested, any recent trips taken, or possible\\nexposures to illness help the physician make a diagnosis.\\nBlood tests can aid in identifying an infectious agent by\\ndetecting the presence of antibodies against it or provid-\\ning samples for growth of the organism in a culture.\\nBlood tests can also provide the doctor with white blood\\ncell counts.

Antibodies are proteins produced by the\\nimmune system in response to specific infectious agents,\\nsuch as viruses or bateria. Febrile agglutinins are anti-\\nbodies that cause red blood cells to clump, but only when\\nthe blood is warmed to temperatures higher than the\\naverage body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).\\nPurpose\\nThe febrile agglutinins test is used to confirm the\\ndiagonsis of certain infectious diseases that stimulate the\\nbody to produce febrile agglutinins. The disease most\\ncommonly diagnosed by this test is brucellosis, a infec-\\ntion caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella\\nand characterized by intermittent fever, sweating, chills,\\naches, and mental depression. The test is also used to\\ndiagnose certain other infectious diseases: salmonellosis,\\ncaused by Salmonella bacteria and marked by nausea and\\nsevere diarrhea ; rickettsial infections, a group of dis-\\neases caused by the bacteria Rickettsia ; and tularemia ,\\nalso called rabbit fever, a bacterial infection character-\\nized by a high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The\\nfebrile agglutinins test can also be used to confirm the\\npresence of two types of cancer, leukemia and lym-\\nphoma; however, doctors rarely use the test for this pur-\\npose, since other diagnostic tests are more reliable.\\nDescription\\nA febrile agglutinins test can be performed at a doc-\\ntor’s office or a hospital. A nurse or technician will col-\\nlect a few drops of blood (about 7ml) in a small tube that\\nhas been cooled slightly. The specimen is then taken to a\\nlaboratory where it heated and examined for clumping. If\\nthe cells clump after warming and unclump as they cool,\\na febrile agglutinin titer (concentration) of greater than\\n1:80 is present.\\nNormal results\\nThe results of febrile agglutinins tests require a doc-\\ntor’s interpretation.

Body temperature is not constant all day, but\\nactually is lowest at 6 A.M. and highest around 4–6 P.M. In\\naddition, temperature varies in different regions of the\\nbody; for example, rectal and urine temperatures are\\nabout one degree Fahrenheit higher than oral temperature\\nand rectal temperature is higher than urine. It is also\\nimportant to realize that certain normal conditions can\\neffect body temperature, such as pregnancy, food inges-\\ntion, age, and certain hormonal changes.\\nSubstances that cause fever are known as “pyro-\\ngens.” There are two types of pyrogens; exogenous and\\nendogenous. Those that originate outside the body, such\\nas bacterial toxins, are called “exogenous” pyrogens.\\nPyrogens formed by the body’s own cells in response to\\nan outside stimulus (such as a bacterial toxin) are called\\n“endogenous” pyrogens.\\nResearchers have discovered that there are several\\n“endogenous” pyrogens. These are made up of small\\ngroups of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.\\nThese natural pyrogens have other functions in addition\\nto inducing fever; they have been named “cytokines”.\\nWhen cytokines are injected into humans, fever and\\nchills develop within an hour. Interferon, tumor necrosis\\nfactor, and various interleukins are the major fever pro-\\nducing cytokines.\\nThe production of fever is a very complex process;\\nsomehow, these cytokines cause the thermoregulatory\\ncenter in the hypothalamus to reset the normal tempera-\\nture level. The body’s initial response is to conserve heat\\nby vasoconstriction, a process in which blood vessels nar-\\nrow and prevent heat loss from the skin and elsewhere.\\nThis alone will raise temperature by two to three degrees.\\nCertain behavioral activities also occur, such as adding\\nmore clothes, seeking a warmer environment, etc. If the\\nhypothalamus requires more heat, then shivering occurs.\\nFever is a body defense mechanism. It has been\\nshown that one of the effects of temperature increase is to\\nslow bacterial growth. However, fever also has some\\ndownsides; the body’s metabolic rate is increased and\\nwith it, oxygen consumption. This can have a devastating\\neffect on those with poor circulation. In addition, fever\\ncan lead to seizures in the very young.\\nWhen temperature elevation occurs for an extended\\nperiod of time and no cause is found, the term FUO is\\nthen used. The far majority of these patients are eventual-\\nly found to have one of several diseases.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAIDS—Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is\\noften represented by these initials. The disease is\\nassociated with infection by the human immunod-\\neficiency virus (HIV), and has the main feature of\\nrepeated infections, due to failure of certain parts\\nof the immune system. Infection by HIV damages\\npart of the body’s natural immunity, and leads to\\nrecurrent illnesses.\\nAntibiotic—A medication that is designed to kill\\nor weaken bacteria.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT Scan)—A spe-\\ncialized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections\\nof the area in question can be examined in detail.\\nThis allows physicians to examine organs such as\\nthe pancreas, bile ducts, and others which are\\noften the site of hidden infections.\\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—This is a\\nnew technique similar to CT Scan, but based on\\nthe magnetic properties of various areas of the\\nbody to compose images.\\nNSAID—Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\nare medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen that\\ndecrease pain and inflammation. Many can now\\nbe obtained without a doctor’s prescription.\\nUltrasound—A non-invasive procedure based on\\nchanges in sound waves of a frequency that can-\\nnot be heard, but respond to changes in tissue\\ncomposition.

The decrease in infec-\\ntions as a cause of FUO is due in part to improved culture\\ntechniques. In addition, technological advances have\\nmade it easier to diagnose non-infectious causes. For\\nexample, tumors and autoimmune diseases in particular\\nare now easier to diagnose.

Nonetheless, if a careful, logical,\\nand thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will be\\nfound in most cases. The patient’s past medical history as\\nwell as travel, social, and family history should be care-\\nfully searched for important clues.\\nUsually the first step is to search for an infectious\\ncause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as\\ntuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool,\\nare generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number of\\ninfectious agents can be measured; if these are rising,\\nthey may point to an active infection.\\nVarious x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to\\nstandard examinations, recently developed radiological\\ntechniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan\\n(CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans\\nare now available.

If the basic illness is easily treatable\\nand can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cure\\nis quite good. Some patients continue with temperature\\nelevations for six months or more; if no serious disease is\\nfound, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decrease\\nthe effects of the fever.

Excessive bleeding and clotting injures\\nbody organs, and causes anemia or death.\\nDescription\\nCoagulation begins typically with an injury to some\\npart of the body. The injury sets in motion a cascade of\\nbiochemical activities (the coagulation cascade) to stop\\nthe bleeding, by forming a clot from a mixture of the\\nblood protein fibrin and platelets.\\nOnce bleeding is stopped, another blood protein dis-\\nsolves the clot by breaking down the fibrin into frag-\\nments. Measurement of these fragments gives informa-\\ntion about the clot dissolving portion of coagulation,\\ncalled fibrinolysis.\\nIn DIC, the coagulation cascade is triggered in an\\nabnormal way. A blood infection, a transfusion reaction,\\na large amount of tissue damage, such as a burn, a dead\\nfetus, and some cancers can begin the chain of biochemi-\\ncal events leading to blood clots. The coagulation cas-\\ncade becomes overwhelmed with excessive clotting fol-\\nlowed by excessive bleeding.

It is converted to fibrin during the blood-clot-\\nting process (coagulation).\\nPurpose\\nThe fibrinogen test aids in the diagnosis of suspected\\nclotting or bleeding disorders caused by fibrinogen\\nabnormalities.\\nPrecautions\\nThis test is not recommended for patients with active\\nbleeding, acute infection or illness, or in those patients\\nwho have received blood transfusions within four weeks.\\nDrugs that may increase fibrinogen levels include\\nestrogens and oral contraceptives. Drugs that may cause\\ndecreased levels include anabolic steroids, androgens,\\nphenobarbital, urokinase, streptokinase, and valproic acid.\\nDescription\\nFibrinogen plays two essential roles in the body: it is\\na protein called an acute-phase reactant that becomes ele-\\nvated with tissue inflammation or tissue destruction, and\\nit is also a vital part of the “common pathway” of the\\ncoagulation process.\\nIn order for blood to clot, fibrinogen must be con-\\nverted to fibrin by the action of an enzyme called throm-\\nbin. Fibrin molecules clump together to form long fila-\\nments, which trap blood cells to form a solid clot.\\nThe conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is the last step\\nof the “coagulation cascade,” a series of reactions in the\\nblood triggered by tissue injury and platelet activation.\\nWith each step in the cascade, a coagulation factor in the\\nblood is converted from an inactive to an active form.\\nThe active form of the factor then activates several mole-\\ncules of the next factor in the series, and so on, until the\\nfinal step, when fibrinogen is converted into fibrin.\\nThe factors involved in the coagulation cascade are\\nnumbered I, II, and V through XIII. Factor I is fibrino-\\ngen, while factor II (fibrinogen’s immediate precursor) is\\ncalled prothrombin. Most of the coagulation factors are\\nmade in the liver, which needs an adequate supply of vit-\\namin K to manufacture the different clotting factors.\\nWhen fibrinogen acts as an “acute-phase reactant,” it\\nrises sharply during tissue inflammation or injury. When\\nthis occurs, high fibrinogen levels may be a predictor for\\nan increased risk of heart or circulatory disease. Other\\nconditions in which fibrinogen is elevated are cancers of\\nthe stomach, breast, or kidney, and inflammatory disor-\\nders like rheumatoid arthritis.\\nReduced fibrinogen levels can be found in liver dis-\\nease, prostate cancer , lung disease, bone marrow\\nlesions, malnourishment, and certain bleeding disorders.\\nThe low levels can be used to evaluate disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation (DIS), a serious medical condi-\\ntion that develops when there is a disturbed balance\\nbetween bleeding and clotting.

It is not a cancer, and the majority of\\ntypes of fibrocystic conditions do not increase the risk of\\nbreast cancer.\\nDescription\\nThere is no such thing as a normal or typical female\\nbreast. Breasts come in all shapes and sizes, with varying\\ntextures from smooth to extremely lumpy. The tissues of\\nthe female breast change in response to hormone levels,\\nnormal aging, nursing ( lactation ), weight fluctuations,\\nand injury. To further complicate matters, the breast has\\nseveral types of tissue; each of these tissue types may\\nrespond differently to changes in body chemistry.\\nFibrocystic breast condition may be called fibrocystic\\ndisease, although it is clearly not a single, specific disease\\nprocess. Variations or changes in the way the breast feels or\\nlooks on x ray may cause the condition to be called “fibro-\\ncystic change.” Other names have been used to refer to this\\nimprecise and ill-defined term: mammary dysplasia,\\nmastopathy, chronic cystic mastitis, indurative mastopathy,\\nmastalgia, lumpy breasts, or physiologic nodularity.\\nEstimates vary, but 40–90% of all women have some\\nevidence of “fibrocystic” condition, change, or disease. It\\nis most common among women between the ages 30 and\\n50, but may be seen at other ages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFibrocystic condition of the breast refers to technical\\nfindings on diagnostic testing (signs); however, this dis-\\ncussion focuses on symptoms that may fall under the\\ngeneral category of the fibrocystic condition. First, a\\nbrief review of the structure and function of the breast\\nmay be useful.\\nThe breast is not supposed to be a soft, smooth organ.\\nIt is actually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ ver-\\nsion of sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appro-\\npriate hormonal and environmental stimulation.\\nThe normal breast contains milk glands, with their\\naccompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting the\\nmilk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,\\nbut can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrous\\nconnective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymph\\nvessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes and\\ntextures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. It is no\\nwonder that a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform in\\ntexture and that the “lumpiness” may wax and wane.\\nThe fibrocystic condition refers to the tenderness,\\nenlargement, and/or changing “lumpiness” that many\\nwomen encounter just before or during their menstrual\\nperiods. At this time, female hormones are preparing the\\nbreasts for pregnancy, by stimulating the milk-produc-\\ning cells, and storing fluid. Each breast may contain as\\nmuch as three to six teaspoons of excess fluid. Swelling,\\nwith increased sensitivity or pain, may result. If preg-\\nnancy does not occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, and\\nthe engorgement and discomfort are relieved.\\nSymptoms of fibrocystic breast condition range\\nfrom mildly annoying in some women to extremely\\npainful in others. The severity of discomfort may vary\\nfrom month to month in the same woman. Although\\nsometimes distressing, this experience is the body’s nor-\\nmal response to routine hormonal changes.\\nThis cycle of breast sensitivity, pain and/or enlarge-\\nment, can also result from medications. Some hormone\\nreplacement therapies (estrogen and progesterone) used\\nfor postmenopausal women can produce these effects.\\nOther medications, primarily, but not exclusively those\\nwith hormones may also provoke these symptoms.\\nBreast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called\\n“noncyclic” pain. “Trigger-zone breast pain” is a term\\nthat may also be used to describe this area-specific pain.\\nThis type of pain may be continuous, or it may be felt\\nintermittently. Trauma, such as a blow to the chest area, a\\nprior breast biopsy, or sensitivity to certain medications\\nmay also underlie this type of pain. Fibrocystic condition\\nof the breast may be cited as the cause of otherwise unex-\\nplained breast pain.\\nLumps, apart from those clearly associated with hor-\\nmone cycles, may also be placed under the heading of\\nfibrocystic condition. These lumps stand out from enlarged\\ngeneral breast tissue. Although noncancerous lumps may\\noccur, the obvious concern with such lumps is cancer.\\nNoncancerous breast lumps include:\\n• Adenosis. This condition refers to the enlargement of\\nbreast lobules, which contain a greater number of glands\\nthan usual. If a group of lobules are found near each\\nother, the affected area may be large enough to be felt.\\n• Cysts. These are fluid-filled sacs in the breast and proba-\\nbly develop as ducts that become clogged with old cells\\nin the process of normal emptying and filling. Cysts usu-\\nally feel soft and round or oval. However a cyst deep\\nwithin the breast may feel hard, as it pushes up against\\nfirmer breast tissue. A woman with a cyst may experi-\\nence pain, especially if it increases in size before her\\nmenstrual cycle, as is often the case. Women between the\\nage of 30 and 50 are most likely to develop cysts.\\n• Epithelial hyperplasia. Also called proliferative breast\\ndisease, this condition refers to an overgrowth of cells\\nlining either the ducts or the lobules.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1323\\nFibrocystic condition of the breast'),\n",

They are most common-\\nly found in adolescents and women in their early twen-\\nties but can occur at any age.\\n• Fibrosis.

A number of other benign\\n(noncancerous) breast problems may be placed under\\nthe heading of “fibrocystic condition.” These problems\\ninclude disorders that may lead to breast inflammation\\n(mastitis), infection, and/or nipple discharge.\\nAtypical ductal hyperplasia\\nThe condition known as atypical ductal hyperplasia\\n(ADH) is a condition in which the cells lining the milk\\nducts of the breast are growing abnormally. This condi-\\ntion may appear as spots of calcium salts, or calcifica-\\ntions, on the mammogram. A biopsy removed from the\\nbreast would confirm the diagnosis. Atypical ductal\\nhyperplasia is not a cancer. In most women, this condi-\\ntion will cause no problems. However, for some women,\\nespecially women with family histories of breast cancer,\\nthe risk of developing breast cancer is increased. (One\\nstudy with over 3,000 female participants indicated that\\nabout 20% of the participants with atypical hyperplasia\\nand a family history of breast cancer developed breast\\ncancer, as compared to the 8% of participants who devel-\\noped the disease with atypical hyperplasia and no family\\nhistory of breast cancer.) For women with ADH and a\\nfamily history of breast cancer, more frequent mammo-\\ngrams and closer monitoring may be required.\\nDiagnosis\\nBreast cancer is the most common concern of\\nwomen who feel a breast lump or experience an abnor-\\nmal breast symptom. For peace of mind, and to rule out\\nany possibility of cancer, any newly discovered breast\\nlumps should be brought to the attention of a family\\nphysician or an obstetrician-gynecologist. He or she will\\nobtain a history and conduct thorough physical exami-\\nnation of the area. Depending on the findings on physi-\\ncal examination, the patient is usually referred for tests.\\nThe most common of these tests include:\\n•Mammography. A mammogram is an x-ray examina-\\ntion of the breasts. The two major types of abnormali-\\nties doctors look for are masses and calcifications;\\neither abnormality may be benign or malignant. The\\nsize, shape, and edges of these masses help doctors\\ndetermine whether or not cancer is present. Sometimes,\\nhowever, this test may be difficult to interpret, however,\\ndue to dense breast tissue.\\n• Ultrasonography. If a suspicious lump is detected during\\nmammography, an ultrasound (the use of high-frequen-\\ncy sound waves to outline the shape of various organs\\nand tissues in the body) is useful (although not defini-\\ntive) in distinguishing benign from cancerous growths.\\n• Ductography. A ductogram (also called a galactogram)\\nis a test that is sometimes useful in evaluating nipple\\ndischarge. A very fine tube is threaded into the opening\\nof the duct onto the nipple. A small amount of dye is\\ninjected, outlining the shape of the duct on an x ray, and\\nindicates whether or not there is a mass in the duct.\\n• Biopsy. If a lump cannot be proven benign by mammog-\\nraphy and ultrasound, a breast biopsy may be considered.\\nUsually a tissue sample is removed through a needle\\n(fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or FNAB) to obtain a\\nsample of the lump. The sample is examined under the\\nmicroscope by a pathologist, and a detailed diagnosis\\nregarding the type of benign lesion or cancer is estab-\\nlished. In some cases, however, FNAB may not provide a\\nclear diagnosis, and another type of biopsy (such as a\\nsurgical biopsy, core-needle biopsy, or other stereotactic\\nbiopsy methods—such as the Mammotome or Advanced\\nBreast Biopsy Instrument) may be required.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1324\\nFibrocystic condition of the breast\\nA mammogram of a female breast indicating multiple cysts.\\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

A positive response\\nto appropriate therapies often confirms the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nOnce a specific disorder within the broad category\\nof fibrocystic condition is identified, treatment can be\\nprescribed. There are a number of treatment options for\\nwomen with a lump that has been diagnosed as benign. If\\nit is not causing a great deal of pain, the growth may be\\nleft in the breast. However, some women may choose to\\nhave a lump such as a fibroadenoma surgically removed,\\nespecially if it is large. Another option to relieve the dis-\\ncomfort of a painful benign lump is to have the cyst suc-\\ntioned, or drained. If there is any uncertainty regarding\\ndiagnosis, the fluid may be sent to the lab for analysis.\\nSymptoms of cycle breast sensitivity and engorge-\\nment may also be treated with diet, medication, and/or\\nphysical modifications. For example,\\n• Although there is no scientific data to support this\\nclaim, many women have reported relief of symptoms\\nwhen caffeine was reduced or eliminated from their\\ndiets. Decreasing salt before and during the period\\nwhen breasts are most sensitive may also ease swelling\\nand discomfort. Low-fat diets and elimination of dairy\\nproducts also appear to decrease soreness for some\\nwomen. However, it may take several months to realize\\nthe effects of these various treatments.\\n• Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) may be recommended.\\nIn some cases, treatment with prescription drugs such\\nas hormones or hormone blockers may prove success-\\nful. Oral contraceptives may also be prescribed.\\n• Warm soaks or ice packs may provide comfort. A well-\\nfitted support bra can minimize physical movement and\\ndo much to relieve breast discomfort. Breast massage\\nmay promote removal of excess fluid from tissues and\\nalleviate symptoms. Massaging the breast with castor\\noil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils, can\\nhelp reduce and dissipate fibroadenomas as well as keep\\nwomen in touch with changes in their breast tissue.\\n• Infections are often treated with warm compresses and\\nantibiotics. Lactating women are encouraged to contin-\\nue breastfeeding because it promotes drainage and\\nhealing. However, a serious infection may progress to\\nform an abscess that may need surgical drainage.\\n• Some studies of alternative or complementary treat-\\nments, although controversial, have indicated that vita-\\nmins A, B complex and E, and mineral supplements\\nmay reduce the risk of developing fibrocystic condition\\nof the breast.

Although the pain is present\\nmost of the time and may last for years, the severity of\\nthe pain is changeable and dependent on individual\\npatient perception.\\nSymptoms of fatigue may result from the individ-\\nual’s chronic pain coupled with anxiety about the prob-\\nlem and how to find relief.

Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nFibromyomas see Uterine fibroids\\nFibrous breast lumps see Fibroadenoma\\nFifth disease\\nDefinition\\nFifth disease is a mild childhood illness caused by\\nthe human parvovirus B19 that causes flu-like symptoms\\nand a rash. It is called fifth disease because it was fifth on\\na list of common childhood illnesses that are accompa-\\nnied by a rash, including measles , rubella or German\\nmeasles, scarlet fever (or scarlatina), and scarlatinella, a\\nvariant of scarlet fever.\\nDescription\\nThe Latin name for the disease is erythema infectio-\\nsum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the\\n“slapped cheek disease” because, when the bright red\\nrash first appears on the cheeks, it looks as if the face has\\nbeen slapped. Anyone can get the disease, but it occurs\\nmore frequently in school-aged children. The disease is\\nusually mild, and both children and adults usually recov-\\ner quickly without complications. In fact, some individu-\\nals exhibit no symptoms and never even feel ill. Out-\\nbreaks most often occur in the winter and spring.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19,\\na member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that lives\\nin the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus is\\nspread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Because\\nthe virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply,\\nit attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, a\\nperson is believed to be immune to reinfection.\\nSymptoms may appear four to 21 days after being\\nexposed to the virus. Initial symptoms are flu-like and\\ninclude headache, body ache, sore throat, a mild fever\\nof 101°F (38.3°C), and chills. It is at this time, prior to\\nthe development of the rash, that individuals are conta-\\ngious. These symptoms last for two to three days. In chil-\\ndren, a bright red rash that looks like a slap mark devel-\\nops suddenly on the cheeks. The rash may be flat or\\nraised and may or may not be itchy. Sometimes, the rash\\nspreads to the arms, legs, and trunk, where it has a lace-\\nlike or net-like appearance. The rash can also involve the\\npalms of the hands and soles of the feet. By the time the\\nrash appears, individuals are no longer infectious. On\\naverage, the rash lasts for 10–11 days, but may last for as\\nlong as five to six weeks. The rash may fade away and\\nthen reappear upon exposure to sunlight, hot baths, emo-\\ntional distress, or vigorous exercise.\\nAdults generally do not develop a rash, but instead may\\nhave swollen and painful joints, especially in the hands and\\nfeet. In adults, symptoms such as sore throat, headache,\\nmuscle and joint pain, abdominal pain,diarrhea, and vom-\\niting occur more frequently than in children and are usually\\nmore severe. The joint pain can be arthritis-like and last for\\nseveral months, especially in women, but the disease does\\nnot appear to progress to rheumatoid arthritis.\\nThe virus causes the destruction of red blood cells\\nand, therefore, a deficiency in the oxygen-carrying\\ncapacity of the blood (anemia) can result. In healthy peo-\\nple, the anemia is mild and only lasts a short while. In\\npeople with weakened immune systems, however, either\\nbecause they have a chronic disease like AIDS or cancer\\n(immunocompromised), or are receiving medication to\\nsuppress the immune system (immunosuppressed), such\\nas organ transplant recipients, this anemia can be severe\\nand last long after the infection has subsided. Symptoms\\nof anemia include fatigue, lack of color, lack of energy,\\nand shortness of breath . Some individuals with sickle\\ncell anemia, iron deficiency, a number of different hered-\\nitary blood disorders, and those who have received bone\\nmarrow transplantations may be susceptible to develop-\\ning a potentially life-threatening complication called a\\ntransient aplastic crisis where the body is temporarily\\nunable to form new red blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1328\\nFifth disease'),\n",

The virus can\\nalso aggravate symptoms for people with an autoimmune\\ndisease called systemic lupus erythematosus.\\nThere is some concern about fifth disease in pregnant\\nwomen. Although no association with an increased number\\nof birth defects has been demonstrated, there is concern\\nthat infection during the first three months of pregnancy\\nmay lead to a slight increase in the number of miscarriages.\\nThere is also some concern that infection later in pregnancy\\nmay involve a very small risk of premature delivery or still-\\nbirths. As a result, women who get fifth disease while they\\nare pregnant should be monitored closely by a physician.\\nDiagnosis\\nFifth disease is usually suspected based on a\\npatient’s symptoms, including the typical appearance of\\nthe bright red rash on the cheeks, patient history, age, and\\nthe time of year. The physician will also exclude other\\npotential causes for the symptoms and rash, including\\nrubella,infectious mononucleosis , bacterial infections\\nlike Lyme disease, allergic reactions, and lupus.\\nIn addition, there is a blood test for fifth disease, but it\\nis generally used only for pregnant women and for people\\nwho have weakened immune systems or who suffer from\\nblood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia.

The symptoms can be treated using over-the\\ncounter medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol)\\nor ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). If the rash itches, calamine\\nlotion can be applied.

Stamford: Appleton Lange, 1988.\\nLata Cherath, PhD\\nFilariasis\\nDefinition\\nFiliariasis is the name for a group of tropical dis-\\neases caused by various thread-like parasitic round\\nworms (nematodes) and their larvae. The larvae transmit\\nthe disease to humans through a mosquito bite. Filariasis\\nis characterized by fever, chills, headache , and skin\\nlesions in the early stages and, if untreated, can progress\\nto include gross enlargement of the limbs and genitalia in\\na condition called elephantiasis.\\nDescription\\nApproximately 170 million people in the tropical and\\nsubtropical areas of southeast Asia, South America, Africa,\\nand the islands of the Pacific are affected by this debilitat-\\ning parasitic disease. While filariasis is rarely fatal, it is the\\nsecond leading cause of permanent and long-term disabili-\\nty in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO)\\nhas named filariasis one of only six “potentially eradica-\\nble” infectious diseases and has embarked upon a 20-year\\ncampaign to eradicate the disease.\\nIn all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi-\\nvidual then bites another uninfected individual, transfer-\\nring some of the worm larvae to the new host. Once with-\\nin the body, the larvae migrate to a particular part of the\\nbody and mature to adult worms. Filariasis is classified\\ninto three distinct types according to the part of the body\\nthat becomes infected: lymphatic filariasis affects the cir-\\nculatory system that moves tissue fluid and immune cells\\n(lymphatic system); subcutaneous filariasis infects the\\nareas beneath the skin and whites of the eye; and serous\\ncavity filariasis infects body cavities but does not cause\\ndisease. Several different types of worms can be respon-\\nsible for each type of filariasis, but the most common\\nspecies include the following:Wucheria bancrofti, Bru-\\ngia malayi (lymphatic filariasis), Onchocerca volvulus,\\nLoa loa, Mansonella streptocerca, Dracunculus medi-\\nnensis(subcutaneous filariasis), Mansonella pustans ,\\nand Mansonella ozzardi (serous cavity filariasis).\\nThe two most common types of the disease are Ban-\\ncroftian and Malayan filariasis, both forms of lymphatic\\nfilariasis. The Bancroftian variety is found throughout\\nAfrica, southern and southeastern Asia, the Pacific\\nislands, and the tropical and subtropical regions of South\\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Malayan filariasis occurs\\nonly in southern and southeastern Asia. Filariasis is occa-\\nsionally found in the United States, especially among\\nimmigrants from the Caribbean and Pacific islands.\\nA larvae matures into an adult worm within six\\nmonths to one year and can live between four and six\\nyears. Each female worm can produce millions of larvae,\\nand these larvae only appear in the bloodstream at night,\\nwhen they may be transmitted, via an insect bite, to anoth-\\ner host. A single bite is usually not enough to acquire an\\ninfection, therefore, short-term travelers are usually safe.\\nA series of multiple bites over a period of time is required\\nto establish an infection. As a result, those individuals who\\nare regularly active outdoors at night and those who spend\\nmore time in remote jungle areas are at an increased risk\\nof contracting the filariasis infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common\\nform of the disease, the disease is caused by the adult\\nworms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near the\\nlymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause local\\ninflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actually\\nobstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue to\\nbecome enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs and\\ngenitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari-\\nety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes of\\ninflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system,\\nespecially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affected\\narea to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarse\\nskin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis.\\nIn conjunctiva filariasis, the worms’ larvae migrate\\nto the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneath\\nthe skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti-\\nva). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind-\\nness known as onchocerciasis.\\nSymptoms vary, depending on what type of parasitic\\nworm has caused the infection, but all infections usually\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1330\\nFilariasis'),\n",

There may also\\nbe swelling, redness, and pain in the arms, legs, or scro-\\ntum. Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result of\\ndying worms or a secondary bacterial infection.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history,\\nperforming a physical examination , and by screening\\nblood specimens for specific proteins produced by the\\nimmune system in response to this infection (antibodies).\\nEarly diagnosis may be difficult because, in the first\\nstages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections.\\nTo make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for a\\npattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc-\\ntion, together with the patient’s possible exposure to\\nfilariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar-\\nvae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, but\\nbecause mosquitos, which spread the disease, are active\\nat night, the larvae are usually only found in the blood\\nbetween about 10 pm and 2 am.\\nTreatment\\nEither ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba-\\nmazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat-\\ning the larvae, impairing the adult worms’ ability to\\nreproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu-\\nnately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible.\\nThe medication is started at low doses to prevent reac-\\ntions caused by large numbers of dying parasites.\\nWhile effective, the medications can cause severe\\nside effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either of\\nthe drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the\\nblood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can cause\\nsevere allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filled\\nsores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlled\\nusing antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs (cor-\\nticosteroids). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine\\nin someone with very high levels of parasite infection\\nmay lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain (encephali-\\ntis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and\\nconfusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive\\nnumbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drug\\nreactions include dizziness, weakness, and nausea.\\nSymptoms caused by the death of the parasites\\ninclude fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain,\\nnausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and\\nasthma. Reactions usually begin within two days of start-\\ning treatment and may last between two and four days.\\nNo treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may\\nbe used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drain\\nthe fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery\\nmay also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro-\\ntum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat-\\ning the legs and providing support with elastic bandages.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially\\nif the patient can avoid being infected again. The disease\\nis rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter-\\nvention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare.\\nPrevention\\nThe best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent\\nbeing repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the\\ndisease. Some methods of preventing insect bites include\\nthe following:\\n• limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or\\njungle areas\\n• wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored\\nclothing that attracts mosquitoes\\n• avoid perfumes and colognes\\n• treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per-\\nmethrin (Duramon, Permanone)\\n• wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children,\\ntry citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects\\n• if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor\\nscreens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep\\n• use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less\\nactive\\nIn addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest-\\ned areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before being\\nbitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien-\\ntists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nInfectious Disease.Ed. Barbara A. Bannister, et al.

The\\nfingertip is the site where extensor and flexor tendons\\ninsert. Fingertip injuries are extremely common since the\\nhands hold a wide array of objects. In 2001, the approxi-\\nmately 10% of all accidents in the United States referred\\nfor Emergency Room consults involve the hand. Hand\\ninjuries are frequently the result of job injuries and\\naccount for 11–14% of on-the-job injuries and 6% of\\ncompensation paid injuries. Injury to the nail bed occurs\\nin approximately 15–24% of fingertip injuries.\\nFingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue\\nloss. The injury is assessed whether the bone and underly-\\ning tissue are intact and the size of the wound area. The\\npulp is the area of skin opposite the fingernail and is usu-\\nally very vulnerable to injury. Pulp injuries commonly\\noccur in persons who use or are in close contact with fast\\nmoving mechanical devices. These injuries can crush, cut,\\nand puncture. The fingertips can also be injured by com-\\nmon crushing accidents. This could cause the develop-\\nment of a subungal hematoma (an accumulation of blood\\nunder the nail). At the base of the distal phalanx (the first\\ncircular skin fold from the tip) injuries can occur that can\\nfracture the underlying bone in the area.

These fractures can be simple, requiring\\nlittle treatment or more complicated involving the joint.\\nThe accident may involve the point of insertion of a ten-\\ndon. Usually this occurs when the terminal joint is being\\nforced to flex while held straight. This motion typically\\noccurs when tucking in sheets during bed making, a com-\\nmon cause of tendon injury. This injury causes a loss of\\nextension (straightening the finger) ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAccidental amputations will usually result in profuse\\nbleeding and tissue loss. Injuries to the pulp can occur as\\nfrom fast moving mechanical instruments, such as drills.\\nThese injuries may puncture the pulp. Injuries such as a\\nsubungal hematoma are caused by a crushing type injury.\\nFractures typically occur as the result of crushing injuries\\nor tendon avulsion. These crushing injuries are frequently\\ncaused during sport injury and can be treated by simple\\ninterventions such as immobilization or more complex\\nprocedures if tendons are affected (the trauma is then\\ntreated as a tendon injury). Fractures can cause pain and,\\ndepending on the extent of swelling, there may be some\\nrestriction of movement. Tendon injuries can be caused\\nwhen the terminal joint is exposed to force flexing motion\\n(moving the finger toward the palm) while held straight.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe attending clinician should evaluate the injury in\\na careful and systematic manner. The appearance of the\\nhand can provide valuable information concerning pres-\\nence of fractures, vascular status, and tendon involve-\\nment. Bones and joints should be evaluated for motion\\nand tenderness. Nerves should be examined for sensory\\n(feeling sensations) and motor (movement) functioning.\\nAmputations usually profusely bleed and there is tissue\\nloss. The wound is treated based on loss of tissue, bone,\\nand wound area. Injuries to the pulp can be obvious dur-\\ning inspection. Subungal hematoma usually present a\\npurplish-black discoloration under the nail. This is due to\\na hematoma underneath the nail. Radiographs may be\\nrequired to assess the alignment of fractures or detect\\nforeign bodies. Patients usually suffer from pain since\\ninjuries to the fingertip bone are usually painful and\\nmovement may be partially restricted due to swelling of\\nthe affected area.

With these types of wounds\\nKEY TERMS\\nDistal—Movement away from the origin.\\nFlex—To bend.\\nLaceration—A cut in the skin\\nPhalanx—A bone of the fingers or toes.\\nTendon—A structure that connects a skeletal mus-\\ncle to bone.\\nhealthy tissue will usually grow and replace the injured\\narea. Larger wounds may require surgical intervention.\\nPuncture wounds should be cleaned and left open to heal.\\nPatients typically receive antibiotics to prevent infec-\\ntion. A procedure called trephining treats subungal\\nhematomas. This procedure is usually done with a\\nstraight cutting needle positioned over the nail. The clini-\\ncian spins the needle with forefinger and thumb until a\\nhole is made through the nail.\\nPatients who have extensive crush injuries or subun-\\ngal hematomas involving laceration to skin folds or nail\\ndamage should have the nail removed to examine the\\nunderlying tissue (called the matrix). Patients who have a\\nclosed subungal hematoma with an intact nail and no\\nother damage (no nail disruption or laceration) are treat-\\ned conservatively. If the fracture is located two-thirds\\nbelow the fingertip immobilization using a splint may be\\nneeded. Conservative treatment is recommended for\\ncrush injuries that fracture the terminal phalanx if a sub-\\nungal hematoma is not present. Severe fractures near the\\nfist circular skin crease may require surgical correction\\nto prevent irregularity of the joint surface, which can\\ncause difficulty with movement.

Three of\\nthese illnesses include ciguatera, scombroid, and paralyt-\\nic shellfish poisoning.\\nCiguatera\\nDefinition\\nCiguatera (from the Spanish word for a poisonous\\nsnail) is a food-related illness that causes abdominal and\\nneurological symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCiguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin\\ncalled ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquired\\nby the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro-\\nduced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates).\\nThe fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin are\\nthose that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap-\\nper, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likely\\nto contain the toxin. Although not as common in the\\nUnited States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed on\\nmany of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.\\nIllness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min-\\nutes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur one\\nto six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initial\\nsymptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or\\nwatery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of\\nthe illness are those involving the nervous system. These\\ninclude numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,\\nand mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the\\nmouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,\\npatients may complain of temporary blindness, a slow\\npulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patients\\nmay also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot and\\ncold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel very\\nhot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, there\\nmay be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure.\\nDiagnosis\\nCiguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina-\\ntion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readily\\navailable blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, but\\nsome researchers have developed a test for the toxin left\\non any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in a\\ntropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught from\\none of these distant areas, and can then be shipped and\\neaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases to\\nlocal public health officials because more cases may\\noccur from other contaminated fish.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment for this illness is general. Patients are\\ngiven fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica-\\ntions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/or\\ndiarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom-\\nfort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that has\\nbeen used for depression) may be useful. Other medica-\\ntions may also be given.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough death can occur, almost all patients diag-\\nnosed with ciguatera will recover. Recovery, however,\\ncan be slow and some symptoms can last for weeks or\\neven months. Symptoms can also be aggravated by other\\nillnesses or alcohol.\\nPrevention\\nKnowing the kinds of fish linked to ciguatera can\\nhelp a person avoid eating high-risk fish. However, over\\n400 different kinds of fish have been linked to the dis-\\nease, even salmon. A particular fish in a given area may\\nbe more likely to cause ciguatera than other fish. For\\nexample, red snapper is most often the source of ciguat-\\nera in the Pacific, while barracuda is more likely to con-\\ntain the toxin in Florida. This is why it is illegal to sell\\nbarracuda in Florida for human consumption. Cooking\\nthe fish does not prevent ciguatera.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1334\\nFish and shellfish poisoning'),\n",

Fish linked to this disease\\nare usually in the Scombridae family, which includes yel-\\nlowfin tuna, skipjack, bonito, and mackerel.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScombroid occurs after eating fish that has not\\nbeen properly refrigerated after capture. Unlike ciguat-\\nera, the toxins linked with scombroid are not contracted\\nby the fish from its surroundings. Bacteria that are nor-\\nmally found in fish act directly on a chemical (called\\nhistidine) in the flesh of fish that are not properly\\ncooled when stored. This interaction produces hista-\\nmine and other chemicals that cause the illness when\\nthe fish is eaten.\\nSymptoms of scombroid occur quickly after eating\\nthe fish, as soon as 10 minutes. Since histamine is\\nreleased by certain cells in the body during an allergic\\nreaction, scombroid can be confused with a fish allergy.\\nScombroid causes flushing of the face, sweating, a burn-\\ning feeling in the mouth or throat, vomiting, diarrhea,\\nand headaches. A rash that looks like a sunburn may\\noccur, and a small number of patients have hives. Some\\npatients have a metallic or peppery taste in their mouths.\\nIn more severe cases, rapid pulse, blurred vision, and dif-\\nficulty breathing can occur. Symptoms usually last about\\nfour hours.\\nDiagnosis\\nLike ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed\\nbased on typical symptoms occurring after eating fish.\\nThere are usually no available tests for the patient.\\nExperimentally, however, elevated levels of histamine-\\nrelated products have been found in the urine. It may\\nbe possible for public health officials to test any\\nremaining fish flesh for histamine levels. Improperly\\nrefrigerated fish caught in both temperate and tropical\\nwaters have been linked to the illness. An outbreak of\\nsimilar cases may be helpful in correctly diagnosing\\nthe problem.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment for scombroid is usually general.\\nAntihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may\\nshorten the duration of the illness, but the illness will go\\naway on its own. Some doctors have found that cimeti-\\ndine (Tagamet) given through a vein may be helpful as\\nwell. In rare, more severe cases, epinephrine (adrenaline)\\nmay be used.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlgae—Plants that have one cell.\\nHistamine —A chemical found naturally in the\\nbody that produces inflammation and increases\\nblood flow; the uncomfortable symptoms of an\\nallergy attack or an allergic reaction are generally\\ncaused by the release of histamine.\\nToxin—A poisonous substance usually produced\\nby a living thing.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough sometimes dramatic and alarming symptoms\\ncan occur, scombroid is usually not serious. The patient\\nshould be reassured that scombroid is not a fish allergy.\\nPrevention\\nAdequate storage of the target fish will always pre-\\nvent scombroid. Since the fish does not appear spoiled or\\nsmell bad, the consumer cannot detect the risk of the ill-\\nness before eating the fish. Cooking the fish does not pre-\\nvent scombroid. Suspected cases should be reported to\\npublic health officials.\\nParalytic shellfish poisoning\\nDefinition\\nParalytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a nervous system\\ndisease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that con-\\ntain environmental toxins. These toxins are produced by a\\ngroup of algae (dinoflagellates). It is unclear whether these\\ntoxins are related to the “blooming” of the algae, also\\ncalled red tide because the algae can turn the water reddish\\nbrown. PSP occurs mostly in May through November.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPSP develops usually within minutes after eating a\\ncontaminated shellfish, most commonly a mussel, clam,\\nor oyster. Symptoms include headache, a floating feel-\\ning, dizziness , lack of coordination, and tingling of the\\nmouth, arms, or legs. Muscle weakness causing difficulty\\nswallowing or speaking may occur. Abdominal symptoms\\nsuch as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur.\\nUnlike ciguatera and scombroid, PSP may have a much\\nmore serious outcome. PSP may cause difficulty breath-\\ning related to weakness or paralysis of the breathing\\nmuscle. The symptoms may last for six to 12 hours, but a\\npatient may continue to feel weak for a week or more.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1335\\nFish and shellfish poisoning'),\n",

No\\nblood or urine test is available to diagnose the illness, but\\ntests in mice to detect the toxin from the eaten fish can be\\ndone by public health officials.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early\\nsymptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush the\\ntoxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications that\\ncreate diarrhea. V omiting may be induced if the patient\\nhas no signs of weakness. In cases where the muscles of\\nbreathing are weakened, the patient may be placed on a\\nrespirator until the weakness goes away.

Likewise, the use of a\\nmachine to clean the blood (dialysis) has been used in\\nsevere cases.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for PSP is quite good, especially if\\nthe patient has passed the initial 12 hours of illness with-\\nout needing breathing support.

This tissue death, called\\nnecrosis or gangrene, spreads rapidly. This disease can\\nbe fatal in as little as 12 to 24 hours.\\nDescription\\nAlthough the term is technically incorrect, flesh-eat-\\ning disease is an apt descriptor: the infection appears to\\ndevour body tissue. Media reports increased in the mid-\\ndle and late 1990s, but the disease is not new. Hip-\\npocrates described it more than three millennia ago and\\nthousands of reports exist from the Civil War. Approxi-\\nmately 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur\\nin the United States each year.\\nFlesh-eating disease is divided into two types. Type I\\nis caused by anaerobic bacteria, with or without the pres-\\nence of aerobic bacteria. Type II, also called hemolytic\\nstreptococcal gangrene, is caused by group A streptococ-\\nci; other bacteria may or may not be present. The disease\\nmay also be called synergistic gangrene.\\nType I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen,\\nand genital area. For example, Fournier’s gangrene is a\\n“flesh-eating” disease in which the infection encompass-\\nes the external genitalia. The arms and legs are most\\noften affected in type II fasciitis, but the infection may\\nappear anywhere.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe two most important factors in determining\\nwhether or not a person will develop flesh-eating disease\\nare: the virulence (ability to cause disease) of the bacteria\\nand the susceptibility (ability of a person’s immune sys-\\ntem to respond to infection) of the person who becomes\\ninfected with this bacteria.\\nIn nearly every case of flesh-eating disease, a skin\\ninjury precedes the disease. As bacteria grow beneath the\\nskin’s surface, they produce toxins. These toxins destroy\\nsuperficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and deep fascia. In\\nsome cases, the overlying dermis and the underlying\\nmuscle are also affected.\\nInitially, the infected area appears red and swollen\\nand feels hot. The area is extremely painful, which is a\\nprominent feature of the disease. Over the course of\\nhours or days, the skin may become blue-gray, and fluid-\\nfilled blisters may form.

An individual may go into shock and\\ndevelop dangerously low blood pressure. Multiple organ\\nfailure may occur, quickly followed by death.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe appearance of the skin, paired with pain and\\nfever raises the possibility of flesh-eating disease. An x\\nray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed\\ntomography scans (CT scans) of the area reveals a\\nfeathery pattern in the tissue, caused by accumulating\\ngas in the dying tissue. Necrosis is evident during\\nexploratory surgery, during which samples are collected\\nfor bacterial identification.\\nTreatment\\nRapid, aggressive medical treatment, specifically,\\nantibiotic therapy and surgical debridement, is impera-\\ntive. Antibiotics may include penicillin, an aminoglyco-\\nside or third-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycin\\nor metronidazole. Analgesics are employed for pain con-\\ntrol. During surgical debridement, dead tissue is stripped\\naway. After surgery, patients are rigorously monitored for\\ncontinued infection, shock, or other complications. If\\navailable, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also be used.\\nPrognosis\\nFlesh-eating disease has a fatality rate of about 30%.\\nDiabetes, arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression, kidney\\ndisease,malnutrition, and obesity are connected with a\\npoor prognosis. Older individuals and intravenous drug\\nusers may also be at higher risk. The infection site also\\nhas a role. Survivors may require plastic surgery and may\\nhave to contend with permanent physical disability and\\npsychological adjustment.\\nPrevention\\nFlesh-eating disease, which occurs very rarely, can-\\nnot be definitively prevented. The best ways to lower the\\nrisk of contracting flesh-eating disease are:\\n• take care to avoid any injury to the skin that may give\\nthe bacteria a place of entry\\n• when skin injuries do occur, they should be promptly\\nwashed and treated with an antibiotic ointment or spray\\n• people who have any skin injury should rigorously\\nattempt to avoid people who are infected with streptococ-\\nci bacteria.

They\\nare prescribed according to a patient’s emotional disposi-\\ntion, as ascertained by the therapist, doctor, or patients\\nthemselves.\\nPurpose\\nFlower remedies are more homeopathic than herbal\\nin the way they work, effecting energy levels rather than\\nchemical balances. They have been described as “liquid\\nenergy.” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’\\nhealing energy, and are said to deal with and overcome\\nnegative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flow\\nof human energy that can cause illness.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nPerhaps the most famous and widely used system is\\nthe Bach flower remedies. This system originated in the\\n1920s when British physician and bacteriologist, Dr.\\nEdward Bach (1886–1936), noticed that patients with\\nphysical complaints often seemed to be suffering from\\nanxietyor some kind of negative emotion. He concluded\\nthat assessing a patient’s emotional disposition and pre-\\nscribing an appropriate flower essence could treat the\\nphysical illness. Bach was a qualified medical doctor, but\\nhe also practiced homeopathy.\\nAs a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach\\nbegan a search for a new and simple system of medicine\\nthat would treat the whole person. In 1930, he gave up his\\nflourishing practice on Harley Street at the Royal London\\nHomeopathic Hospital and moved to the countryside to\\ndevote his life to this research. It is known that at this\\npoint, he ceased to dispense the mixture of homeopathy\\nand allopathic medicine that he had been using. Instead, he\\nbegan investigating the healing properties of plant\\nessences and discovered that he possessed an “intuition”\\nfor judging the properties of each flower. Accordingly, he\\ndeveloped the system of treatment that bears his name, and\\nis also the foundation for all other flower-remedy systems.\\nThe Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the only\\nsystem of significance from the 1920s until in the 1970s,\\nwhen there was a renewed interest in the subject by doc-\\ntors working in the field of natural medicine. Perhaps the\\nmost notable was Dr. Richard Katz, who was seeking new\\nmethods of dealing with modern stress and the resulting\\nailments. He focused on the concept of a psychic, psycho-\\nlogical effect and chose to pursue this line of research.\\nIn 1979, Katz founded the Flower Essence Society\\nin California, (FES). This society pledged to further the\\nresearch and development of Bach’s principles. As of\\n2000, FES hosts a database of over 100 flower essences\\nfrom more than 50 countries. FES is now an international\\norganization of health practitioners, researchers, stu-\\ndents, and others concerned with flower essence therapy.\\nThe Society has connections with an estimated\\n50,000 active practitioners from around the world, who\\nuse flower essence therapy as part of their treatment. FES\\nencourages the study of the plants themselves to deter-\\nmine the characteristics of flower essences. They are\\ncompiling an extensive database of case studies and prac-\\ntitioner reports of the use of essences therapeutically,\\nallowing verification and development of the original\\ndefinitions. They are also engaged in the scientific study\\nof flower essence therapy.\\nFES says they have developed the theories of Paracel-\\nsus and Goethe who researched the “signatures” and “ges-\\ntures” of botanical specimens, on the premise that the\\nhuman body and soul are a reflection of the system of\\nnature. FES plant research interprets the therapeutic prop-\\nerties of flower essences according to these insights.\\nIn this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of\\nperception” for monitoring the attributes of plants. Each\\nof these windows reveals an aspect of the plant’s quali-\\nties, although they maintain that what they are seeking is\\na “whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.” The\\n12 windows are not considered independent classifica-\\ntions, but more of a blended tapestry of views of the\\nqualities that each plant possesses.\\nThe first window is concerned with the “form” of a\\nplant—its shape classification. The second focuses on its\\n“gesture” or spatial relationship. The third window is a\\nplant’s botanical classification; the Flower Essence Soci-\\nety maintains that considering a plant’s botanical family\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1338\\nFlower remedies'),\n",

The fourth window concerns the time ori-\\nentation of a particular specimen regarding the daily and\\nseasonal cycles. Why do some flowers bloom at different\\ntimes of the day, while others, such as the evening prim-\\nrose, respond to the moon? The fifth window observes a\\nplant’s relationship to its environment. Where a plant\\nchooses to grow, and where it cannot survive, reveals\\nmuch about its qualities. The sixth window observes a\\nplant’s relationship to the Four Elements and the Four\\nEthers, as FES maintains that plants exist in one of the\\nelemental or etheric forces in addition to their physical\\nlife. “Elements” refers to those developed by the Greeks,\\nas opposed to the modern concept of “molecular building\\nblocks.” It seems that commonly, two elements predomi-\\nnate in a plant, indicating a polarity of qualities, while\\ntwo can be said to be recessive. The seventh window\\nrelates to a plant’s relationship with the other kingdoms of\\nnature: mineral, animal and human, while the eighth\\nrelates to the color and color variations of a plant. Katz\\nexplains how the language of color tells us so much about\\nthe “soul qualities” of a plant. The ninth window concerns\\nall other sensory perceptions of a plant, such as fragrance,\\ntexture, and taste. The tenth window involves assessing\\nthe chemical substances and properties; the eleventh stud-\\nies medicinal and herbal uses, as by studying the physical\\nhealing properties of plants, we can also understand\\nsomething of their more subtle effects on the soul. Finally,\\nthe twelfth window involves the study of the lore, mythol-\\nogy, folk wisdom, and spiritual and ritual qualities associ-\\nated with a particular plant. Katz relates how in the past,\\nhuman beings were more in touch with the natural world,\\nand the remnants of this unconscious plant wisdom live\\non in the form of folklore, mythology, and so on.\\nBecause flower remedies operate on approximately\\nthe same principles as homeopathy, practitioners quite\\noften prescribe the two therapies in conjunction with\\neach other. They can also be used concurrently with allo-\\npathic medicine.\\nThe system consists of 38 remedies, each for a dif-\\nferent disposition. The basic theory is that if the remedy\\nfor the correct disposition is chosen, the physical illness\\nresulting from the present emotional state can then be\\ncured. There is a rescue remedy made up of five of the\\nessences—cherry plum, clematis, impatiens, rock star,\\nand star of Bethlehem—that is recommended for the\\ntreatment of any kind of physical or emotional shock.\\nTherapists recommended that rescue remedy be kept on\\nhand to help with all emergencies.\\nThe 38 Bach Remedies\\n• agrimony: puts on a cheerful front, hides true feelings,\\nand worries or problems\\nEDWARD BACH (1886–1936)\\nEdward Bach was a graduate of University College\\nHospital (M.B., B.S., M.R.C.S.) in England. He left his\\nflourishing Harley Street practice in favor of homeopa-\\nthy, seeking a more natural system of healing than allo-\\npathic medicine. He concluded that healing should be\\nas simple and natural as the development of plants,\\nwhich were nourished and given healing properties by\\nearth, air, water, and sun.\\nBach believed that he could sense the individual\\nhealing properties of flowers by placing his hands over\\nthe petals. His remedies were prepared by floating sum-\\nmer flowers in a bowl of clear stream water exposed to\\nsunlight for three hours.\\nHe developed 38 remedies, one for each of the\\nnegative states of mind suffered by human beings,\\nwhich he classified under seven group headings: fear,\\nuncertainty, insufficient interest in present circum-\\nstances, loneliness, over-sensitivity to influences and\\nideas, despondency or despair, and overcare for the\\nwelfare of others.

Fluke\\ninfections are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants,\\nor animals from fluke-infected waters. Symptoms vary\\naccording to the type of fluke infection.\\nDescription\\nIn humans, fluke infections can be classified accord-\\ning to those diseases caused by liver flukes and those\\ncaused by lung flukes. Diseases caused by liver flukes\\ninclude fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis.\\nCases of liver fluke infection have been reported in Europe\\nand the United States, as well as the Middle East, China,\\nJapan, and Africa. Diseases caused by lung flukes include\\nparagonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is a common infection in\\nthe Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South\\nAmerica, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. It is estimated\\nthat between 40 million and 100 million people worldwide\\nsuffer from either liver or lung fluke infections.\\nIn their adult stage, liver and lung flukes are sym-\\nmetrical in shape, ranging between 1/4–1 in in length,\\nand look somewhat like long, plump leaves or blades of\\ngrass. They enter through the mouth and can infect any\\nperson at any age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat\\naccording to the type of fluke involved. All forms of liver\\nand lung fluke infection, however, have the following\\ncharacteristics:\\n• most persons who get infected do not develop symp-\\ntoms (asymptomatic)\\n• the early symptoms of an acute fluke infection are not\\nunique to these diseases alone (nonspecific symptoms)\\n• infection does not confer immunity against re-infection\\nby the same species or infection by other species of\\nflukes\\n• infection is usually associated with eating uncooked\\nfish, plants, or animals that live in fresh water\\nFascioliasis\\nFascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica , the\\nsheep liver fluke. The fluke has a three-part life cycle that\\nbegins when eggs from a host’s feces are deposited in\\nwater. The eggs release free-swimming larvae\\n(miracidia) that infect snails. The snails then release free-\\nswimming larvae with tails (cercariae) that form cysts\\ncontaining larvae in the infective stage (metacercariae)\\non vegetation growing in fresh water. Humans become\\ninfected when they eat watercress, water chestnuts, or\\nother plants covered with the encysted metacercariae.\\nWhen a person eats contaminated plants, the cysts\\nare broken open in the digestive system, and the metacer-\\ncariae leave their cysts, pass through the wall of the\\nintestine, and enter the liver, where they cause inflamma-\\ntion and destroy tissue. After a period of 10–15 weeks in\\nthe liver, the adult flukes move to the bile ducts and pro-\\nduce eggs. Acute fascioliasis is marked by abdominal\\npainwith headache, loss of appetite, anemia, and vomit-\\ning. Some patients develop hives, muscle pains, or a yel-\\nlow-color to the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice).\\nChronic forms of the disease may produce complica-\\ntions, including blockage of the bile ducts or the migra-\\ntion of adult flukes to other parts of the body.\\nOpisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis\\nThese infections are caused by Clonorchis sinensis,\\nthe Chinese liver fluke, and Opisthorchis viverrini or O.\\nfelineus . The diseases are widespread, affecting more\\nthan 20 million people in Japan, China, Southeast Asia,\\nand India. The life cycle of these liver flukes is similar to\\nthat of F . hepaticaexcept that the etacercariae are encyst-\\ned in freshwater fish rather than on plants.

A cross-reaction occurs in blood testing\\nwhen a particular disease agent reacts with antibodies\\nspecific to another disease agent. This result means that\\nthe doctor may know that the person is infected by\\nflukes but cannot tell from the blood test alone which\\nspecific type of fluke is causing the disease. In addition,\\nblood tests for fluke infections cannot distinguish\\nbetween past and current infections. In some cases,\\nsophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed\\ntomography scans (CT scans) or ultrasound scans of\\nthe patient’s chest or brain (for lung flukes) or abdomen\\n(for liver flukes), are useful in confirming a diagnosis\\nof fluke infection.\\nTreatment\\nLiver and lung fluke infections are treated with med-\\nications. These include triclabendazole, praziquantel,\\nbithionol, albendazole, and mebendazole. Praziquantel\\nworks by paralyzing the flukes’ suckers, forcing them to\\ndrop away from the walls of the host’s blood vessels. In\\nthe United States, bithionol is available only from the\\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC).

These vitamins help the\\nbody break down complex carbohydrates into simple sug-\\nars to be used for energy. Excess B vitamins are excreted\\nfrom the body rather than stored for later use. This is why\\nsufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary.\\nDescription\\nFolic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is\\none of the nutrients most often found to be deficient in\\nthe Western diet, and there is evidence that deficiency is\\na problem on a worldwide scale. Folic acid is found in\\nleafy green vegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver,\\nbeets, brussel sprouts, poultry, nutritional yeast, tuna,\\nwheat germ, mushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli,\\nspinach, bananas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998,\\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required\\nfood manufacturers to add folic acid to enriched bread\\nand grain products to boost intake and to help prevent\\nneural tube defects (NTD).\\nPurpose\\nFolic acid works together with vitamin B12 and vita-\\nmin C to metabolize protein in the body. It is important\\nfor the formation of red and white blood cells. It is neces-\\nsary for the proper differentiation and growth of cells and\\nfor the development of the fetus. It is also used to form\\nthe nucleic acid of DNA and RNA. It increases the\\nappetite and stimulates the production of stomach acid\\nfor digestion and it aids in maintaining a healthy liver. A\\ndeficiency of folic acid may lead to anemia, in which\\nthere is decreased production of red blood cells. This\\nreduces the amounts of oxygen and nutrients that are able\\nto get to the tissues. Symptoms may include fatigue ,\\nreduced secretion of digestive acids, confusion, and for-\\ngetfulness. During pregnancy , a folic acid deficiency\\nmay lead to preeclampsia, premature birth, and increased\\nbleeding after birth.\\nPeople who are at high risk of strokes and heart dis-\\nease may greatly benefit by taking folic acid supple-\\nments. An elevated blood level of the amino acid homo-\\ncysteine has been identified as a risk factor for some of\\nthese diseases. High levels of homocysteine have also\\nbeen found to contribute to problems with osteoporosis.\\nFolic acid, together with vitamins B6 and B12, helps break\\ndown homocysteine, and may help reverse the problems\\nassociated with elevated levels.\\nPregnant women have an increased need for folic\\nacid, both for themselves and their child. Folic acid is\\nnecessary for the proper growth and development of the\\nfetus. Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for the pre-\\nvention of several types of birth defects , particularly\\nNTDs. The neural tube of the embryo develops into the\\nbrain, spinal cord, spinal column, and the skull. If this\\ntube forms incompletely during the first few months of\\npregnancy a serious, and often fatal, defect results in\\nspina bifidaor anencephaly. Folic acid, taken from one\\nyear to one month before conception through the first\\nfour months of pregnancy, can reduce the risk of NTDs\\nby 50–70%. It also helps prevent a cleft lip and palate.\\nResearch shows that folic acid can be used to suc-\\ncessfully treat cervical dysplasia, a condition diagnosed\\nby a Pap smear, of having abnormal cells in the cervix.\\nThis condition is considered to be a possible precursor to\\ncervical cancer, and is diagnosed as an abnormal Pap\\nsmear. Daily consumption of 1,000 mcg of folic acid for\\nthree or more months has resulted in improved cervical\\ncells upon repeat Pap smears.\\nStudies suggest that long-term use of folic acid sup-\\nplements may also help prevent lung and colon cancer .\\nResearchers have also found that alcoholics who have\\nlow folic acid levels face a greatly increased possibility\\nof developing colon cancer.\\nPreparations\\nTo correct a folic acid deficiency, supplements are\\ntaken in addition to food. Since the functioning of the B\\nvitamins is interrelated, it is generally recommended that\\nthe appropriate dose of B-complex vitamins be taken in\\nplace of single B vitamin supplements. The Recom-\\nmended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate is 400 mcg\\nper day for adults, 600 mcg per day for pregnant women,\\nand 500 mcg for nursing women. Medicinal dosages of\\nup to 1,000-2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nFolic acid is not stable. It is easily destroyed by\\nexposure to light, air, water, and cooking. Therefore, the\\nsupplement should be stored in a dark container in a\\ncold, dry place, such as a refrigerator. Many medications\\ninterfere with the body’s absorption and use of folic acid.\\nThis includes sulfa drugs, sleeping pills, estrogen, anti-\\nconvulsants, birth control pills,antacids , quinine, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1347\\nFolic acid'),\n",

Recent research has shown that adequate amounts\\nof folic acid can prevent up to half of these birth defects,\\nif women start taking folic acid supplements shortly\\nbefore conception.\\nA healthy adult needs at least 400 mcg of folic acid\\nevery day. Requirements at least double during pregnan-\\ncy, and increase by 50% when a woman is breastfeeding.\\nThe average American diet, high in fats, sugar, and white\\nflour, provides about 200 mcg of folic acid, approximate-\\nly the amount needed to maintain tissue stores of the sub-\\nstance for six to nine months before a deficiency devel-\\nops. Most of the folic acid in foods (with the exception of\\nthe folic acid added to enriched flour and breakfast cere-\\nals) occurs as folate. Folate is only about half as available\\nfor the body to use as is the folic acid in pills and supple-\\nments. Folate also is easily destroyed by sunlight, over-\\ncooking, or the storing of foods at room temperature for\\nan extended period of time.\\nGood dietary sources of folate include:\\n• leafy green vegetables\\n•l i v e r\\n• mushrooms\\n• oatmeal\\n• peanut butter\\n• red beans\\n•s o y\\n• wheat germ\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThis condition usually results from a diet lacking in\\nfoods with high folic acid content, or from the body’s\\ninability to digest foods or absorb foods having high folic\\nacid content.

FSH is a hormone that\\nregulates the growth and development of eggs and sperm,\\nand this test is used to diagnose or evaluate disorders\\ninvolving the pituitary gland and reproductive system.\\nPurpose\\nFSH testing is performed if a physician suspects the\\npatient may have a disorder involving the reproductive\\nsystem or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces\\nFSH, which stimulates the growth of the sacks (follicles)\\nthat surround the eggs in a woman’s ovaries. This is\\nimportant for the process of ovulation, in which the egg\\nis released. In men, FSH stimulates production of sperm.\\nIf there are abnormal levels of FSH in the blood it may\\nmean that one of several disorders are present. Normal\\nfluctuations occur as a result of puberty, the menstrual\\ncycle, pregnancy, and menopause.\\nThe FSH test is performed more often on women than\\non men. In women, it is used to determine if menopause\\nhas begun, to diagnose infertility and menstrual disor-\\nders (such as anovulatory bleeding), to measure hormone\\nlevels in children who enter puberty at an early age, and to\\ndiagnose other disorders. In men, it can be used to deter-\\nmine early puberty, abnormal tissue growth on one or more\\nof the hormone-secreting (endocrine) glands (called multi-\\nple endocrine neoplasia), or to diagnose other disorders.\\nDescription\\nThe FSH test is a blood test. Blood will be drawn\\nfrom the patient and analyzed in a laboratory.\\nPreparation\\nIn preparation for the test, there are no food or fluid\\nintake restrictions. Patients may be advised to discontinue\\ncertain medications for 48 hours before the test. A men-\\nstruating woman having hot flashes or irregular periods\\nshould be tested on the second or third day of her menstru-\\nal cycle. A woman who has missed a period and is having\\nother menopausal symptoms can be tested at any time.\\nAftercare\\nNo aftercare is necessary.\\nRisks\\nThere are no risks associated with this test.\\nNormal results\\nNormal FSH test results vary according to age and\\nsexual maturity. The phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle\\nor use of birth-control pills also affects test results.\\nFor an adult male, normal results range from about\\n4–25 units of FSH in every liter of blood (U/L) or about\\n5–20 micro-international units in every milliliter.\\nFor a premenopausal woman, normal values range\\nfrom 4–30 U/L or 5–20 micro-international units per milli-\\nliter. In a pregnant woman, FSH levels are too low to mea-\\nsure. After menopause, normal values range from 40–250\\nU/L or 50–100 micro-international units per milliliter.\\nFSH levels fluctuate during premenopause. If no\\nother symptoms are present, an elevated FSH level should\\nnot be interpreted as proof that menopause has begun.\\nAbnormal results\\nAnorexia nervosaand disorders of the hypothalamus\\nor pituitary gland can result in abnormally low FSH levels.\\nAbnormal levels can also indicate:\\n• infertility\\n• hypopituitarism\\n• klinefelter syndrome (in men)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1350\\nFollicle-stimulating hormone test'),\n",

Some food-borne toxins can affect the\\nnervous system.\\nDescription\\nEvery year millions of people suffer from bouts of\\nvomiting and diarrhea each year that they blame on\\n“something I ate.” These people are generally correct.\\nEach year in the United States, one to two bouts of diar-\\nrheal illness occur in every adult. The Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are\\nfrom six to 33 million cases of food poisoning in the Unit-\\ned States annually. Many cases are mild and pass so rapid-\\nly that they are never diagnosed. Occasionally a severe\\noutbreak creates a newsworthy public health hazard.\\nClassical food poisoning, sometimes incorrectly\\ncalled ptomaine poisoning, is caused by a variety of dif-\\nferent bacteria. The most common are Salmonella ,\\nStaphylococcus aureus ,\\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 or\\nother E. coli strains, Shigella , and Clostridium\\nbotulinum. Each has a slightly different incubation peri-\\nod and duration, but all except C. botulinum cause\\ninflammation of the intestines and diarrhea. Sometimes\\nfood poisoning is called bacterial gastroenteritis or\\ninfectious diarrhea. Food and water can also be contami-\\nnated by viruses (such as the Norwalk agent that causes\\ndiarrhea and the viruses of hepatitis A and E), environ-\\nmental toxins (heavy metals), and poisons produced\\nwithin the food itself (mushroom poisoning or fish and\\nshellfish poisoning).\\nCareless food handling during the trip from farm to\\ntable creates conditions for the growth of bacteria that\\nmake people sick. Vegetables that are eaten raw, such as let-\\ntuce, may be contaminated by bacteria in soil, water, and\\ndust during washing and packing. Home canned and com-\\nmercially canned food may be improperly processed at too\\nlow a temperature or for too short a time to kill the bacteria.\\nRaw meats carry many food-borne bacterial dis-\\neases. The United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) estimates that 60% or more of raw poultry sold at\\nretail carry some disease-causing bacteria. Other raw\\nmeat products and eggs are contaminated to a lesser\\ndegree. Thorough cooking kills the bacteria and makes\\nthe food harmless. However, properly cooked food can\\nbecome re-contaminated if it comes in contact with\\nplates, cutting boards, countertops, or utensils that were\\nused with raw meat and not cleaned and sanitized.\\nCooked foods can also be contaminated after cook-\\ning by bacteria carried by food handlers or from bacteria\\nin the environment. It is estimated that 50% of healthy\\npeople have the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in their\\nnasal passages and throat, and on their skin and hair.\\nRubbing a runny nose, then touching food can introduce\\nthe bacteria into cooked food. Bacteria flourish at room\\ntemperature, and will rapidly grow into quantities capa-\\nble of making people sick. To prevent this growth, food\\nmust be kept hot or cold, but never just warm.\\nAlthough the food supply in the United States is\\nprobably the safest in the world, anyone can get food\\npoisoning. Serious outbreaks are rare. When they occur,\\nthe very young, the very old, and those with immune sys-\\ntem weaknesses have the most severe and life-threaten-\\ning cases. For example, this group is 20 times more like-\\nly to become infected with the Salmonella bacteria than\\nthe general population.\\nTravel outside the United States to countries where\\nless attention is paid to sanitation, water purification, and\\ngood food handling practices increases the chances that a\\nperson will get food poisoning. People living in institu-\\ntions such as nursing homes are also more likely to get\\nfood poisoning.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of food poisoning occur because\\nfood-borne bacteria release toxins or poisons as a\\nbyproduct of their growth in the body. These toxins\\n(except those from C. botulinum ) cause inflammation\\nand swelling of the stomach, small intestine and/or large\\nintestine. The result is abdominal muscle cramping,\\nvomiting, diarrhea,fever, and the chance of dehydra-\\ntion. The severity of symptoms depends on the type of\\nbacteria, the amount consumed, and the individual’s gen-\\neral health and sensitivity to the bacterial toxin.\\nSalmonella\\nAccording to a 2001 report from the CDC,Salmo-\\nnella caused almost 50,000 culture-confirmed cases of\\nfood poisoning in the United States annually. However,\\nbetween two and four million probably occur each year.\\nSalmonellais found in egg yolks from infected chickens,\\nin raw and undercooked poultry and in other meats, dairy\\nproducts, fish, shrimp, and many more foods. The CDC\\nestimates that one out of every 50 consumers is exposed\\nto a contaminated egg yolk each year. However, thorough\\ncooking kills the bacteria and makes the food harmless.\\nSalmonellais also found in the feces of pet reptiles such\\nas turtles, lizards, and snakes.\\nAbout one out of every 1,000 people get food poi-\\nsoning from Salmonella . Of these, two-thirds are under\\nage 20, with the majority under age nine. Most cases\\noccur in the warm months between July and October.\\nSymptoms of food poisoning begin eight to 72 hours\\nafter eating food contaminated with Salmonella .

The symptoms\\ngenerally last one to five days. Dehydration can be a\\ncomplication in severe cases. People generally recover\\nwithout antibiotic treatment, although they may feel tired\\nfor a week after the active symptoms subside.\\nStaphylococcus aureus\\nStaphylococcus aureusis found on humans and in\\nthe environment in dust, air, and sewage. The bacteria is\\nspread primarily by food handlers using poor sanitary\\npractices. Almost any food can be contaminated, but\\nsalad dressings, milk products, cream pastries, and any\\nfood kept at room temperature, rather than hot or cold are\\nlikely candidates.\\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of cases of food\\npoisoning from Staphylococcus aureus that occur each\\nyear, because its symptoms are so similar to those caused\\nby other foodborne bacteria. Many cases are mild and the\\nvictim never sees a doctor.\\nSymptoms appear rapidly, usually one to six hours\\nafter the contaminated food is eaten. The acute symp-\\ntoms of vomiting and severe abdominal cramps without\\nfever usually last only three to six hours and rarely more\\nthan 24 hours. Most people recover without medical\\nassistance. Deaths are rare.\\nEscherichia coli (E. coli)\\nThere are many strains of E. coli, and not all of them\\nare harmful. The strain that causes most severe food poi-\\nsoning is E. coli O157:H7 . Food poisoning by E. coli\\noccurs in three out of every 10,000 people. Foodborne E.\\ncoli is found and transmitted mainly in food derived from\\ncows such as raw milk, raw or rare ground beef and fruit\\nor vegetables that are contaminated.\\nSymptoms of food poisoning from E. coli are slower\\nto appear than those caused by some of the other food-\\nborne bacteria. E. coli produces toxins in the large intes-\\ntine rather than higher up in the digestive system. This\\naccounts for the delay in symptoms and the fact that\\nvomiting rarely occurs in E. coli food poisoning.\\nOne to three days after eating contaminated food, the\\nvictim with E. coli O157:H7begins to have severe abdom-\\ninal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually becomes\\nbloody within 24 hours. There is little or no fever, and\\nrarely does the victim vomit. The bloody, watery diarrhea\\nlasts from one to eight days in uncomplicated cases.\\nCampylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni)\\nAccording to the FDA,C. jejuniis the leading cause of\\nbacterial diarrhea in the United States. It is responsible for\\nmore cases of bacterial diarrhea than Shigella and Salmo-\\nnella combined. Anyone can get food poisoning from C.\\njejuni, but children under five and young adults between\\nthe ages of 15 and 29 are more frequently infected.\\nC. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds,\\nand flies. It is not carried by healthy people in the United\\nStates or Europe. The bacteria is also found ponds and\\nstream water. The ingestion of only a few hundred C.\\njejuni bacteria can make a person sick.\\nSymptoms of food poisoning begin two to five days\\nafter eating food contaminated with C. jejuni . These\\nsymptoms include fever, abdominal pain, nausea,\\nheadache, muscle pain, and diarrhea. The diarrhea can\\nbe watery or sticky and may contain blood. Symptoms\\nlast from seven to 10 days, and relapses occur in about\\none quarter of people who are infected. Dehydration is a\\ncommon complication. Other complications such as\\narthritis-like joint pain and hemolytic-uremic syndrome\\n(HUS) are rare.\\nShigella\\nShigellais a common cause of diarrhea in travelers\\nto developing countries. It is associated with contaminat-\\ned food and water, crowded living conditions, and poor\\nsanitation. The bacterial toxins affect the small intestine.\\nSymptoms of food poisoning by Shigella appear\\n36–72 hours after eating contaminated food. These symp-\\ntoms are slightly different from those associated with most\\nfoodborne bacteria. In addition to the familiar watery diar-\\nrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, chills and fever\\noccur. The diarrhea may be quite severe with cramps pro-\\ngressing to classical dysentery. Up to 40% of children with\\nsevere infections show neurological symptoms. These\\ninclude seizures caused by fever, confusion, headache,\\nlethargy, and a stiff neck that resembles meningitis.\\nThe disease runs its course usually in two to three\\ndays but may last longer. Dehydration is a common com-\\nplication. Most people recover on their own, although\\nthey may feel exhausted, but children who are malnour-\\nished or have weakened immune systems may die.\\nClostridium botulinum (C. botulinum)\\nC. botulinum, which causes both adult botulism and\\ninfant botulism, is unlike any of the other foodborne bac-\\nteria. First,C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium in\\nthat it can only live in the absence of oxygen. Second, the\\ntoxins from C. botulinum are neurotoxins. They poison\\nthe nervous system, causing paralysis without the vomit-\\ning and diarrhea associated with other foodborne illness-\\nes. Third, toxins that cause adult botulism are released\\nwhen the bacteria grows in an airless environment out-\\nside the body. They can be broken down and made harm-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1354\\nFood poisoning'),\n",

Finally, botulism is much more likely to be\\nfatal even in tiny quantities.\\nAdult botulism outbreaks are usually associated\\nwith home canned food, although occasionally commer-\\ncially canned or vacuum packed foods are responsible\\nfor the disease. C. botulinum grows well in non-acidic,\\noxygen-free environments. If food is canned at too low\\nheat or for too brief a time, the bacteria is not killed. It\\nreproduces inside the can or jar, releasing its deadly neu-\\nrotoxin. The toxin can be made harmless by heating the\\ncontaminated food to boiling for ten minutes. However,\\neven a very small amount of the C. botulinum toxin can\\ncause serious illness or death.\\nSymptoms of adult botulism appear about 18–36\\nhours after the contaminated food is eaten, although\\nthere are documented times of onset ranging from four\\nhours to eight days. Initially a person suffering from bot-\\nulism feels weakness and dizziness followed by double\\nvision. Symptoms progress to difficulty speaking and\\nswallowing. Paralysis moves down the body, and when\\nthe respiratory muscles are paralyzed, death results from\\nasphyxiation. People who show any signs of botulism\\npoisoning must receive immediate emergency medical\\ncare to increase their chance of survival.\\nInfant botulism is a form of botulism first recog-\\nnized in 1976. It differs from food-borne botulism in its\\ncauses and symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when a\\nchild under the age of one year ingests the spores of C.\\nbotulinum . These spores are found in soil, but a more\\ncommon source of spores is honey.\\nThe C. botulinum spores lodge in the baby’s intesti-\\nnal tract and begin to grow, producing their neurotoxin.\\nOnset of symptoms is gradual. Initially the baby is consti-\\npated. This is followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weak-\\nness, drooling, and a distinctive wailing cry. Eventually,\\nthe baby loses the ability to control its head muscles.\\nFrom there the paralysis progresses to the rest of the body.\\nDiagnosis\\nOne important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning\\nis for doctors to determine if a number of people have\\neaten the same food and show the same symptoms of ill-\\nness. When this happens, food poisoning is strongly sus-\\npected. The diagnosis is confirmed when the suspected\\nbacteria is found in a stool culture or a fecal smear from\\nthe person. Other laboratory tests are used to isolate bac-\\nteria from a sample of the contaminated food. Botulism\\nis usually diagnosed from its distinctive neurological\\nsymptoms, since rapid treatment is essential. Many cases\\nof food poisoning go undiagnosed, since a definite diag-\\nnosis is not necessary to effectively treat the symptoms.\\nBecause it takes time for symptoms to develop, it is not\\nnecessarily the most recent food one has eaten that is the\\ncause of the symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of food poisoning, except that caused by\\nC. botulinum, focuses on preventing dehydration by\\nreplacing fluids and electrolytes lost through vomiting\\nand diarrhea. Electrolytes are salts and minerals that\\nform electrically charges particles (ions) in body fluids.\\nElectrolytes are important because they control body\\nfluid balance and are important for all major body reac-\\ntions. Pharmacists can recommend effective, pleasant-\\ntasting, electrolytically balanced replacement fluids\\nthat are available without a prescription. When more\\nfluids are being lost than can be consumed, dehydration\\nmay occur. Dehydration more likely to happen in the\\nvery young, the elderly, and people who are taking\\ndiuretics. To prevent dehydration, a doctor may give\\nfluids intravenously.\\nIn very serious cases of food poisoning, medications\\nmay be given to stop abdominal cramping and vomiting.\\nAnti-diarrheal medications are not usually given. Stop-\\nping the diarrhea keeps the toxins in the body longer and\\nmay prolong the infection.\\nPeople with food poisoning should modify their diet.\\nDuring period of active vomiting and diarrhea they\\nshould not try to eat and should drink only clear liquids\\nfrequently but in small quantities. Once active symptoms\\nstop, they should eat bland, soft, easy to digest foods for\\ntwo to three days. One example is the BRAT diet of\\nbananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, all of which are easy\\nto digest. Milk products, spicy food, alcohol and fresh\\nfruit should be avoided for a few days, although babies\\nshould continue to breastfeed. These modifications are\\noften all the treatment that is necessary.\\nSevere bacterial food poisonings are sometimes\\ntreated with antibiotics.

Lutwick, MPH\\nFoot care\\nDefinition\\nFoot care involves all aspects of preventative and\\ncorrective care of the foot and ankle. Doctors specializ-\\ning in foot care are called podiatrists.\\nPurpose\\nDuring an average lifetime, each person walks about\\n115,000 miles and three-quarters of people have foot\\nproblems at some point in their lives.\\nFoot problems can arise from wearing ill-fitting\\nshoes, from general wear and tear, as a result of injury, or\\nas a complication of disease. People with diabetes melli-\\ntus or circulatory diseases are 20 times more likely to\\nhave foot problems than the general public.\\nPodiatrists are doctors who specialize in treating the\\nfoot and ankle. Other doctors who have experience with\\nfoot problems are family physicians, orthopedists, sports\\nmedicine specialists, and those who care for diabetics.\\nProblems with the feet include foot pain, joint inflamma-\\ntion, plantar warts, fungal infections (like athlete’s\\nfoot), nerve disorders, torn ligaments, broken bones, bac-\\nterial infections, and tissue injuries (like frostbite).\\nPrecautions\\nPeople with diabetes or circulatory disorders should\\nbe alert to even small foot problems. In these people, a\\nbreak in the skin can lead to infection,gangrene , and\\namputation.\\nDescription\\nDaily foot care for people likely to develop foot\\nproblems includes washing the feet in tepid water with\\nmild soap and oiling the feet with vegetable oil or a lano-\\nlin-based lotion. Toenails should be cut straight across\\nabove the level of the skin after soaking the feet in tepid\\nwater. Corns and calluses should not be cut. If they need\\nremoval, it should be done under the care of a doctor.\\nAthletes foot and plantar warts should also be treated by\\na doctor if they develop in high risk patients.\\nMany people with diabetes or circulatory disorders\\nhave problems with cold feet. These problems can be\\nreduced by avoiding smoking tobacco (smoking con-\\nstricts the blood vessels), wearing warm socks, not cross-\\ning the legs while sitting or not sitting in one position too\\nlong, or avoiding constricting stockings.\\nPeople with circulatory problems should not use heat-\\ning pads or hot water bottles on their feet, as even moder-\\nate heat can damage the skin if circulation is impaired.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparation other than an understanding\\nof the nature of foot problems is necessary to begin rou-\\ntine foot care.\\nAftercare\\nFoot care is preventative and should be ongoing\\nthroughout a person’s life.\\nRisks\\nThere are no risks associated with foot care. The risks\\nare in ignoring the feet and allowing problems to develop.\\nNormal results\\nWith regular care, foot disorders such as infections,\\nskin ulcers, and gangrene can be prevented.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Foot Problems.” In The Complete Guide to Symptoms, Illness\\nand Surgery.3rd ed.

They also like to\\nstick things in their ears and up their noses. Adults may\\naccidentally swallow a non-food object or inhale a for-\\neign body that gets stuck in the throat. Even if an object\\nlike a toothpick successfully passes through the esopha-\\ngus and into the stomach, it can get stuck inside the rec-\\ntum. Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of people\\nat any age.\\nForeign bodies can be in hollow organs (like swal-\\nlowed batteries) or in tissues (like bullets). They can be\\ninert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause inflam-\\nmation and scarring. They can bring infection with them\\nor acquire it and protect it from the body’s immune\\ndefenses. They can obstruct passageways either by their\\nsize or by the scarring they cause. Some can be toxic.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEyes\\nDust, dirt, sand, or other airborne material can lodge\\nin the eyes, causing minor irritation and redness. More\\nserious damage can be caused by hard or sharp objects\\nthat penetrate the surface and become embedded in the\\ncornea or conjunctiva (the mucous membranes around\\nthe inner surface of the eyelids). Swelling, redness,\\nbleeding from the surface blood vessels, sensitivity to\\nlight, and sudden vision problems are all symptoms of\\nforeign matter in the eyes.\\nEars and nose\\nChildren will sometimes put things into their noses,\\nears, and other openings. Beans, popcorn kernels, raisins,\\nand beads are just a few of the many items that have been\\nfound in these bodily cavities. On occasion, insects may\\nalso fly into the ears and nose. Pain, hearing loss, and a\\nsense of something stuck in the ear are symptoms of for-\\neign bodies in the ears. A smelly, bloody discharge from\\none nostril is a symptom of foreign bodies in the nose.\\nAirways and stomach\\nAt a certain age children will eat anything. A very\\npartial list of items recovered from young stomachs\\nincludes the following: Coins, chicken bones, fish bones,\\nbeads, rocks, plastic toys, pins, keys, round stones, mar-\\nbles, nails, rings, batteries, ball bearings, screws, staples,\\nwashers, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy\\nsoldier. Some of these items will pass right on through\\nand come out the other end. The progress of metal objects\\nhas been successfully followed with a metal detector.\\nOthers, like sharp bones, can get stuck and cause trouble.\\nBatteries are corrosive and must be removed immediately.\\nChildren eat things and stick things into their bodily\\nopenings of their own volition. But they inhale them\\nunwittingly. The most commonly inhaled item is probably\\na peanut. A crayon and a cockroach have been found in a\\nchild’s windpipes. These items always cause symptoms\\n(difficulty swallowing and spitting up saliva, for instance)\\nand may elude detection for some time while the child is\\nbeing treated for asthma or recurring pneumonia.\\nAdults are not exempt from unorthodox inedibles.\\nDental devices are commonly swallowed. Adults with\\nmental illness or subversive motives may swallow inap-\\npropriate objects, such as toothbrushes.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1358\\nForeign objects\\nX ray of swallowed spoon and blade in the intestine.(Photo\\nResearchers.

Sudden sharp pain during elimi-\\nnation may signify that an object is lodged in the rectum.\\nOther symptoms vary depending upon the size of the\\nobject, its location, how long it has been in place, and\\nwhether or not infection has set in.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe symptoms are as diverse as the objects and their\\nlocations. The most common manifestation of a foreign\\nobject anywhere in the body is infection. Even if the\\nobject started out sterile, germs still seem to find it and\\nare able to hide from the body’s defenses there. Blockage\\nof passageways—breathing, digestive or excretory—is\\nanother result. Pain is common.\\nTreatment\\nEyes\\nSmall particles like sand may be removable without\\nmedical help, but if the object is not visible or cannot be\\nretrieved, prompt emergency treatment is necessary.\\nTrauma to the eyes can lead to loss of vision and should\\nnever be ignored. Before attempting any treatment, the\\nperson should move to a well-lighted area where the\\nobject can be more easily spotted. Hands should be\\nwashed and only clean, preferably sterile, materials\\nshould make contact with the eyes. If the particle is\\nsmall, it can be dislodged by blinking or pulling the\\nupper lid over the lower lid and flushing out the speck. A\\nclean cloth can also be used to pick out the offending\\nparticle. Afterwards, the eye should be rinsed with clean,\\nlukewarm water or an opthalmic wash.\\nIf the foreign object cannot be removed at home, the\\neye should be lightly covered with sterile gauze to dis-\\ncourage rubbing. A physician will use a strong light and\\npossibly special eyedrops to locate the object. Surgical\\ntweezers can effectively remove many objects. An\\nantibiotic sterile ointment and a patch may be pre-\\nscribed. If the foreign body has penetrated the deeper\\nlayers of the eye, an opthalmic surgeon will be consulted\\nfor emergency treatment.\\nEars and nose\\nA number of ingenious extraction methods have\\nbeen devised for removing foreign objects from the nose\\nand ears.

To\\nperform the Heimlich maneuver on a conscious\\nadult, the rescuer stands behind the victim and\\nencircles his waist. The rescuer makes a fist with\\none hand and places the other hand on top, posi-\\ntioned below the rib cage and above the waist.\\nThe rescuer then applies pressure by a series of\\nupward and inward thrusts to force the foreign\\nobject back up the victim’s trachea.\\nout by blowing into the mouth while holding the other\\nnostril closed. Skilled practitioners have removed peas\\nfrom the ears by tiny improvised corkscrews; marbles by\\nq-tips with super glue.

This procedure is\\nusually performed by an orthopedist, general surgeon, or\\nfamily doctor. In cases of an emergency, first aid mea-\\nsures should be evoked for temporary realignment and\\nimmobilizationuntil proper medical help is available.\\nPurpose\\nFracture repair is required when there is a need for\\nrestoration of the normal position and function of the bro-\\nken bone. Throughout the stages of fracture healing, the\\nbones must be held firmly in the correct position. In the\\nevent the fracture is not properly repaired, malalignment\\nof the bone may occur, resulting in possible physical dys-\\nfunction of the bone or joint of that region of the body.\\nPrecautions\\nPrecautions for fracture repair are anything found to\\nbe significant with patients’ medical diagnosis and histo-\\nry. This would include an individual’s tolerance to anes-\\nthesia and the presence of bleeding disorders that may be\\npresent to complicate surgery.\\nDescription\\nFracture repair is applied by means of traction ,\\nsurgery, and/or by immobilization of the bones.

With the use of trac-\\ntion, muscle pull on the fracture site is overcome by\\nweights attached to a series of ropes running over pul-\\nleys. Strategically implanted electrical stimulation\\ndevices have proven beneficial in healing a fracture site,\\nespecially when the fracture is healing poorly and repair\\nby other means is difficult.\\nPreparation\\nEmergency splinting may be required to immobilize\\nthe body part or parts involved. When fracture repair is\\nnecessary, the procedure is often performed in a hospital\\nbut can also be successfully done in an outpatient surgi-\\ncal facility, doctor’s office or emergency room. Before\\nany surgery for fracture repair, blood and urine studies\\nmay be taken from the patient. X rays may follow this if\\nnot previously acquired. It has been noted however, that\\nnot all fractures are immediately apparent on an initial\\nx-ray examination. In this case, where a fracture is defi-\\nnitely suspected the extent of the fracture can be properly\\ndiagnosed by repeating the x rays 10–14 days later.\\nDepending upon the situation, local or general anesthesia\\nmay be used for fracture repair.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgery, x rays may be again taken through the\\ncast or splint to evaluate if rejoined pieces remain in good\\nposition for healing. This is usually performed either before\\nthe application of the splint or at least before the patient is\\nawakened from the general anesthesia. The patient needs to\\nbe cautious not to place excess pressure on any part of the\\ncast until it is completely dry. The patient also should avoid\\nexcess pressure on the operative site until complete healing\\nhas taken place and the injury has been re-examined by the\\nphysician. If the cast becomes exposed to moisture it may\\nsoften and require repair. The patient should also be\\ninstructed to keep the injured region propped up whenever\\npossible to reduce the possibility of swelling.\\nRisks\\nSurgical risks of fracture repair are greater in\\npatients over 60 years of age because the bones often tak-\\ning longer to heal properly. Obesity may place extra\\nstress on the healing site, affecting healing and possibly\\nrisking reinjury. Smoking may slow the healing process\\nafter fracture repair, as well as poor nutrition , alco-\\nholism, and chronic illness. Some medications may\\naffect the fracture site, causing poor union. Such medica-\\ntions include anti-hypertensives and cortisone.\\nPossible complications following fracture repair\\ninclude excessive bleeding, improper fit of joined bone\\nends, pressure on nearby nerves, delayed healing, and a\\npermanent incomplete healing of the fracture. If there is\\na poor blood supply to the fractured site with one of the\\nportions of broken bone not properly supplied by the\\nblood, the bony portion will die and healing of the frac-\\nture will not take place. This is called aseptic necrosis.\\nPoor immobilization of the fracture from improper cast-\\ning which permits motion between the bone parts may\\nprevent healing and repair of the bone with possible\\ndeformity. Infection can interfere with bone repair. This\\nrisk is greater in the case of a compound fracture (a bone\\nfracture causing an open wound) where ideal conditions\\nare present for severe streptococcal and staphylococcal\\ninfections . Occasionally, fractured bones in the elderly\\nmay possibly never heal properly. The risk is increased\\nwhen nutrition is poor.\\nNormal results\\nOnce the procedure for fracture repair is completed,\\nthe body begins to produce new tissue to bridge the bro-\\nken pieces. At first, this tissue (called a callus) is soft and\\neasily injured. Later, the body deposits bone minerals\\nuntil the callus becomes a solid piece of bone. The frac-\\nture site is thus strengthened further with extra bone. It\\nusually takes about six weeks for a broken bone to heal\\ntogether. The exact time required for healing depends on\\nthe type of fracture and the extent of damage. Before the\\nuse of x rays, fracture repair was not always accurate,\\nresulting in crippling deformities. With modern x-ray\\ntechnology, the physician can view the extent of the frac-\\nture, check the setting following the repair, and be certain\\nafter the procedure that the bones have not moved from\\ntheir intended alignment. Children’s bones usually heal\\nrelatively rapidly.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1361\\nFracture repair\\nAn x-ray image of a healing fracture.(Photograph by Bates,\\nM.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Compound fractures are also known as\\nopen fractures\\nStaphylococcal infection —An infection caused\\nby any of several pathogenic species of staphylo-\\ncoccus, commonly characterized by the formation\\nof abscesses of the skin or other organs.\\nStreptococcal infection —An infection caused by\\na pathogenic bacteria of one of several species of\\nthe genus streptococcus or their toxins. Almost\\nany organ in the body may be involved.\\nDescription\\nA fracture usually results from traumatic injury to\\nbones causing the continuity of bone tissues or bony carti-\\nlage to be disrupted or broken. Fracture classifications\\ninclude simple, compound, incomplete and complete.\\nSimple fractures (more recently called “closed”) are not\\nobvious as the skin has not been ruptured and remains\\nintact. Compound fractures (now commonly called\\n“open”) break the skin, exposing bone and causing addi-\\ntional soft tissue injury and possible infection. A single\\nfracture means that one fracture only has occurred and\\nmultiple fractures refer to more than one fracture occur-\\nring in the same bone. Fractures are termed complete if\\nthe break is completely through the bone and described as\\nincomplete or “greenstick” if the fracture occurs partly\\nacross a bone shaft. This latter type of fracture is often the\\nresult of bending or crushing forces applied to a bone.\\nFractures are also named according to the specific\\npart of the bone involved and the nature of the break.\\nIdentification of a fracture line can further classify frac-\\ntures. Types include linear, oblique, transverse, longitu-\\ndinal, and spiral fractures. Fractures can be further subdi-\\nvided by the positions of bony fragments and are\\ndescribed as comminuted, non-displaced, impacted,\\noverriding, angulated, displaced, avulsed, and segmental.\\nAdditionally, an injury may be classified as a fracture-\\ndislocation when a fracture involves the bony structures\\nof any joint with associated dislocation of the same joint.\\nFractures line identification\\nLinear fractures have a break that runs parallel to the\\nbone’s main axis or in the direction of the bone’s shaft.\\nFor example, a linear fracture of the arm bone could\\nextend the entire length of the bone. Oblique and trans-\\nverse fractures differ in that an oblique fracture crosses a\\nbone at approximately a 45° angle to the bone’s axis. In\\ncontrast, a transverse fracture crosses a bone’s axis at a\\n90° angle. A longitudinal fracture is similar to a linear\\nfracture. Its fracture line extends along the shaft but is\\nmore irregular in shape and does not run parallel to the\\nbone’s axis. Spiral fractures are described as crossing a\\nbone at an oblique angle, creating a spiral pattern. This\\nbreak usually occurs in the long bones of the body such as\\nthe upper arm bone (humerus) or the thigh bone (femur).\\nBony fragment position identification\\nComminuted fractures have two or more fragments\\nbroken into small pieces, in addition to the upper and\\nlower halves of a fractured bone.

This group includes children\\nand athletes participating in contact sports. Because of an\\nincrease in bone brittleness with aging, elderly persons\\nare also included in this high-risk population. Up to the\\nage of 50, more men suffer from fractures than women\\ndue to occupational hazards. However, after the age of\\n50, women are more prone to fractures than men. Specif-\\nic diseases causing an increased risk for fractures include\\nPaget’s disease, rickets,osteogenesis imperfecta, osteo-\\nporosis, bone cancer and tumors, and prolonged disuse\\nof a nonfunctional body part such as after a stroke.\\nSymptoms of fractures usually begin with pain that\\nincreases with attempted movement or use of the area\\nand swelling at the involved site. The skin in the area\\nmay be pale and an obvious deformity may be present. In\\nmore severe cases, there may be a loss of pulse below the\\nfracture site, such as in the extremities, accompanied by\\nnumbness, tingling, or paralysis below the fracture. An\\nopen or compound fracture is often accompanied by\\nbleeding or bruising.

The primary goal of immobilization\\nis to maintain the realignment of a bone long enough for\\nhealing to start and progress. Immobilization by external\\nfixation uses splints, casts, or braces. This may be the\\nprimary and only procedure for fracture treatment.\\nSplinting to immobilize a fracture can be done with or\\nwithout traction.

It should be done without causing\\nadditional pain and without moving the bone segments.\\nIn a clinical environment, plaster of Paris casts are used\\nfor immobilization. Braces are useful as they often allow\\nmovement above and below a fracture site. Treatments\\nfor stress fractures include rest and decreasing or stop-\\nping any activity that causes or increases pain.\\nFracture reduction\\nFracture reduction is the procedure by which a frac-\\ntured bone is realigned in normal position. It can be\\neither closed or open. Closed reduction refers to realign-\\ning bones without breaking the skin. It is performed with\\nmanual manipulation and/or traction and is commonly\\ndone with some kind of anesthetic. Open reduction pri-\\nmarily refers to surgery that is performed to realign\\nbones or fragments. Fractures with little or no displace-\\nment may not require any form of reduction.\\nTraction is used to help reposition a broken bone. It\\nworks by applying pressure to restore proper alignment.\\nThe traction device immobilizes the area and maintains\\nrealignment as the bone heals. A fractured bone is immo-\\nbilized by applying opposing force at both ends of the\\ninjured area, using an equal amount of traction and coun-\\ntertraction. Weights provide the traction pull needed or\\nthe pull is achieved by positioning the individual’s body\\nweight appropriately. Traction is a form of closed reduc-\\ntion and is sometimes used as an alternative to surgery.\\nSince it restricts movement of the affected limb or body\\npart, it may confine a person to bed rest for an extended\\nperiod of time.\\nA person may need open reduction if there is an open,\\nsevere, or comminuted fracture. This procedure allows a\\nphysician to examine and surgically correct associated soft\\ntissue damage while reducing the fracture and, if neces-\\nsary, applying internal or external devices. Internal fixa-\\ntion involves the use of metallic devices inserted into or\\nthrough bone to hold the fracture in a set position and\\nalignment while it heals. Devices include plates, nails,\\nscrews, and rods. When healing is complete, the surgeon\\nmay or may not remove these devices. Virtually any hip\\nfracture requires open reduction and internal fixation so\\nthat the bone will be able to support the patient’s weight.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIn addition to the importance of calcium for strong\\nbones, many alternative treatment approaches recom-\\nmend use of mineral supplements to help build and main-\\ntain a healthy, resilient skeleton. Some physical thera-\\npists use electro-stimulation over a fractured site to pro-\\nmote and expedite healing. Chinese traditional medicine\\nmay be helpful by working to reconnect chi through the\\nmeridian lines along the line of a fracture. Homeopathy\\ncan enhance the body’s healing process. Two particularly\\nuseful homeopathic remedies are Arnica (Arnica mon-\\ntana) and Symphytum (Symphytum officinalis ). If possi-\\nble, applying contrast hydrotherapy to an extremity\\n(e.g., a hand or foot) of a fractured area can assist healing\\nby enhancing circulation.\\nPrognosis\\nFractures involving joint surfaces almost always lead\\nto some degree of arthritis of the joint. Fractures can nor-\\nmally be cured with proper first aid and appropriate after-\\ncare. If determined necessary by a physician, the frac-\\ntured site should be manipulated, realigned, and immobi-\\nlized as soon as possible. Realignment has been shown to\\nbe much more difficult after six hours. Healing time\\nvaries from person to person with the elderly generally\\nneeding more time to heal completely. A non-union frac-\\nture may result when a fracture does not heal, such as in\\nthe case of an elderly person or an individual with med-\\nical complications. Recovery is complete when there is no\\nbone motion at the fracture site, and x rays indicate com-\\nplete healing. Open fractures may lead to bone infections,\\nwhich delay the healing process.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nFragile X syndrome\\nDefinition\\nFragile X syndrome is the most common form of\\ninherited mental retardation. Individuals with this con-\\ndition have developmental delay, variable levels of men-\\ntal retardation, and behavioral and emotional difficulties.\\nThey may also have characteristic physical traits. Gener-\\nally, males are affected with moderate mental retardation\\nand females with mild mental retardation.\\nDescription\\nFragile X syndrome is also known as Martin-Bell syn-\\ndrome, Marker X syndrome, and FRAXA syndrome. It is\\nthe most common form of inherited mental retardation.\\nFragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR-1\\ngene, located on the X chromosome. The role of the gene is\\nunclear, but it is probably important in early development.\\nIn order to understand fragile X syndrome it is\\nimportant to understand how human genes and chromo-\\nsomes influence this condition. Normally, each cell in the\\nbody contains 46 (23 pairs of) chromosomes. These\\nchromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) needed\\nfor the production of proteins, which lead to growth,\\ndevelopment, and physical/intellectual characteristics.\\nThe first 22 pairs of chromosomes are the same in males\\nand females. The remaining two chromosomes are called\\nthe sex chromosomes (X and Y). The sex chromosomes\\ndetermine whether a person is male or female. Males\\nhave only one X chromosome, which is inherited from\\nthe mother at conception, and they receive a Y chromo-\\nsome from the father. Females inherit two X chromo-\\nsomes, one from each parent. Fragile X syndrome is\\ncaused by a mutation in a gene called FMR-1. This gene\\nis located on the X chromosome. The FMR-1 gene is\\nthought to play an important role in the development of\\nthe brain, but the exact way that the gene acts in the body\\nis not fully understood.\\nFragile X syndrome affects males and females of all\\nethnic groups. It is estimated that there are about one in\\n4,000 to one in 6,250 males affected with fragile X syn-\\ndrome. There are approximately half as many females with\\nfragile X syndrome as there are males. The carrier frequen-\\ncy in unaffected females is one in 100 to one in 600, with\\none study finding a carrier frequency of one in 250.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFor reasons not fully understood, the CGG sequence\\nin the FMR-1 gene can expand to contain between 54\\nand 230 repeats.

People who carry a premutation do not usually\\nhave symptoms of fragile X syndrome; although there\\nhave been reports of individuals with a premutation and\\nsubtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms. Individuals\\nwho carry a fragile X premutation are at risk to have chil-\\ndren or grandchildren with the condition. Female premu-\\ntation carriers may also be at increased risk for earlier\\nonset of menopause; however, premutation carriers may\\nexist through several generations of a family and no\\nsymptoms of fragile X syndrome will appear.\\nThe size of the premutation can expand over suc-\\nceeding generations. Once the size of the premutation\\nexceeds 230 repeats, it becomes a full mutation and the\\nFMR-1 gene is disabled. Individuals who carry the full\\nmutation may have fragile X syndrome. Since the FMR-\\n1 gene is located on the X chromosome, males are more\\nlikely to develop symptoms than females. This is because\\nmales have only one copy of the X chromosome. Males\\nwho inherit the full mutation are expected to have mental\\nimpairment. A female’s normal X chromosome may\\ncompensate for her chromosome with the fragile X gene\\nmutation. Females who inherit the full mutation have an\\napproximately 50% risk of mental impairment.

Prenatal testing should only be undertaken after the\\nfragile X carrier status of the parents has been confirmed\\nand the couple has been counseled regarding the risks of\\nrecurrence. While prenatal testing is possible to do with\\nCVS, the results can be difficult to interpret and addition-\\nal testing may be required.\\nTreatment\\nPresently there is no cure for fragile X syndrome.\\nManagement includes such approaches as speech thera-\\npy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. The\\nexpertise of psychologists, special education teachers,\\nand genetic counselors may also be beneficial. Drugs\\nmay be used to treat hyperactivity, seizures, and other\\nproblems. Establishing a regular routine, avoiding over\\nstimulation, and using calming techniques may also help\\nin the management of behavioral problems. Children\\nwith a troubled heart valve may need to see a heart spe-\\ncialist and take medications before surgery or dental pro-\\ncedures.

Couples with\\none child affected by FA have a 25% chance in each\\npregnancyof conceiving another affected child.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin.\\nNormal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structures\\nknown as mitochondria, where it is thought to be\\ninvolved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, the\\nfrataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with non-\\nsense information known as a “triple repeat.” This extra\\nDNA interferes with normal production of frataxin,\\nthereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-\\n21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence may\\nbe repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symp-\\ntoms and severity of FA seems to be associated with the\\nnumber of repetitions. Patients with more copies have\\nmore severe symptomatology. Researchers are still\\nwrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromo-\\nsome 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggests\\nthat FA develops in part because defects in iron transport\\nprevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.\\nThe nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the\\nspinal cord involved in relaying information between\\nmuscles and the brain. Tight control of movement\\nrequires complex feedback between the muscles promot-\\ning a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. With-\\nout this control, movements become uncoordinated,\\njerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of FA usually first appear between the\\nages of 8 and 15, although onset as early as 18 months or\\nas late as age 25 is possible. The first symptom is usually\\ngait incoordination. A child with FA may graze doorways\\nwhen passing through, for instance, or trip over low\\nobstacles. Unsteadiness when standing still and deterio-\\nration of position sense is common. Foot deformities and\\nwalking up off the heels often results from uneven mus-\\ncle weakness in the legs. Muscle spasms and cramps\\nmay occur, especially at night.\\nAtaxia in the arms follows, usually within several\\nyears, leading to decreased hand-eye coordination. Arm\\nweakness does not usually occur until much later. Speech\\nand swallowing difficulties are common. Diabetes melli-\\ntus may also occur. Nystagmus , or eye tremor, is com-\\nmon, along with some loss of visual acuity. Hearing loss\\nmay also occur. A side-to-side curvature of the spine (sco-\\nliosis) occurs in many cases, and may become severe.\\nHeartbeat abnormalities occur in about two thirds of\\nFA patients, leading to shortness of breath after exer-\\ntion, swelling in the lower limbs, and frequent com-\\nplaints of cold feet.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of FA involves a careful medical history\\nand thorough neurological exam. Lab tests include elec-\\ntromyography, an electrical test of muscle, and a nerve\\nconduction velocity test. An electrocardiogram may be\\nperformed to diagnose heart arrhythmia.\\nDirect DNA testing is available, allowing FA to be\\nmore easily distinguished from other types of ataxia. The\\nsame test may be used to determine the presence of the\\ngenetic defect in unaffected individuals, such as siblings.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1369\\nFriedreich’s ataxia'),\n",

Frostnip is a mild form of\\ncold injury.\\nDescription\\nIn North America, frostbite is largely confined to\\nAlaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent years\\nhave witnessed a substantial decline in the number of\\ncases, probably for several reasons, including better win-\\nter clothing and footwear and greater public understand-\\ning of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the same\\ntime, the nature of the at-risk population has changed as\\nrising numbers of homeless people have made frostbite\\nan urban as well as a rural public health concern. The\\ngrowing popularity of outdoor winter activities has also\\nexpanded the at-risk population.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFrostbite\\nSkin exposed to temperatures a little below the\\nfreezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skin\\ncan freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, wind\\nspeed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes.\\nA strong wind can lower skin temperature considerably\\nby dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air that\\nsurrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heat\\naway from the skin because water is a potent conductor\\nof heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro-\\nduces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing on\\na windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera-\\nture is above the freezing mark.\\nThe extent of permanent injury, however, is deter-\\nmined not by how cold the skin and the underlying tis-\\nsues become but by how long they remain frozen. Conse-\\nquently, homeless people and others whose self-preser-\\nvation instincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatric\\nillness face a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation\\nbecause they are more likely to stay out in the cold when\\nprudence dictates seeking shelter or medical attention.\\nAlcohol also affects blood circulation in the extremities\\nin a way that can increase the severity of injury (as does\\nsmoking). A review of 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases\\nfound a tie to alcohol in 46% and to psychiatric illness in\\n17%. Other risk factors identified by researchers include\\ninadequate clothing, previous cold injury,fatigue ,\\nwound infection, atherosclerosis (an arterial disease),\\nand diabetes.

Tissue freezing\\ncauses ice crystal formation and other changes that damage\\nand eventually kill cells. Much of this harm occurs because\\nthe ice produces pressure changes that cause water (crucial\\nfor cell survival) to flow out of the cells. Tissue hypoxia\\n(oxygen deficiency) occurs when the blood vessels in the\\nhands, feet, and other extremities narrow in response to\\ncold. Among its many tasks, blood transfers body heat to the\\nskin, which then dissipates the heat into the environment.\\nBlood vessel narrowing is the body’s way of protecting vital\\ninternal organs at the expense of the extremities by reducing\\nheat flow away from the core. However, blood also carries\\nlife-sustaining oxygen to the skin and other tissues, and nar-\\nrowed vessels result in oxygen starvation. Narrowing also\\ncauses acidosis (an increase in tissue acidity) and increases\\nblood viscosity (thickness). Ultimately, blood stops flowing\\nthrough the capillaries (the tiny blood vessels that connect\\nthe arteries and veins) and blood clots form in the arterioles\\nand venules (the smallest arteries and veins). Damage also\\noccurs to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.\\nHypoxia, blood clots, and endothelial damage lead, in turn,\\nto the release of inflammatory mediators (substances that\\nact as links in the inflammatory process), which promote\\nfurther endothelial damage, hypoxia, and cell destruction.\\nFrostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec-\\nond, third, or fourth), or simply divided into two types,\\nsuperficial (corresponding to first- or second-degree\\ninjury) and deep (corresponding to third- or fourth-degree\\ninjury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands. The\\nremaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears, nose,\\ncheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected part\\nbegins to feel cold and, usually, numb; this is followed by\\na feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or yellowish.\\nMany patients experience severe pain in the affected part\\nduring rewarming treatment and an intense throbbing pain\\nthat arises two or three days later and can last days or\\nweeks. As the skin begins to thaw during treatment,\\nedema(excess tissue fluid) often accumulates, causing\\nswelling. In second- and higher-degree frostbite, blisters\\nappear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis-\\nters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar\\n(scab). Fourth-degree frostbite penetrates below the skin to\\nthe muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe cases of\\nfrostbite the dead tissue can mummify and drop off. Infec-\\ntion is also a possibility.\\nFrostnip\\nLike frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal\\nformation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs and\\nthe crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip\\naffects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, and\\ntoes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness or\\ntingling in the affected part until warming begins.\\nDiagnosis\\nFrostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina-\\ntion and may also include conventional radiography (x\\nrays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves-\\nsels using an injected dye to provide contrast), thermog-\\nraphy (use of a heat-sensitive device for measuring blood\\nflow), and other techniques for predicting the course of\\ninjury and identifying tissue that requires surgical\\nremoval. During the initial treatment period, however, a\\nphysician cannot judge how a case will progress. Diag-\\nnostic tests only become useful three to five days after\\nrewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized.\\nTreatment\\nFrostbite\\nEmergency medical help should always be sum-\\nmoned whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting for\\nhelp to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tight\\nclothing and put on dry, loose clothing or wraps. A splint\\nand padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbing\\nthe area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The key\\nto prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing and\\nrefreezing, which releases more inflammatory mediators\\nand makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason,\\nthe affected part must be kept away from heat sources such\\nas campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming in\\nthe field only when emergency help will take more than\\ntwo hours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.\\nBecause the outcome of a frostbite injury cannot be\\npredicted at first, all hospital treatment follows the same\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2\\n1371\\nFrostbite and frostnip\\nA human hand with frostbite.

Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part\\nfor 15–30 minutes in water at a temperature of\\n104–108°F (40–42.2°C). This rapid rewarming halts ice\\ncrystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels.\\nAloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) is\\napplied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele-\\nvated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on the\\nextent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned by\\nremoving foreign material) or simply covered with aloe\\nvera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to\\nprevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen to\\ncombat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in most\\ncases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen-\\nsation returns during rewarming. Except when injury is\\nminimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay of\\nseveral days, during which hydrotherapy and physical\\ntherapy are used to restore the affected part to health.\\nExperts recommend a cautious approach to tissue\\nremoval, and advise that 22–45 days must pass before a\\ndecision on amputation can safely be made.\\nFrostnip\\nFrostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air\\non them or holding them under one’s armpits. Other\\nfrostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. The\\ninjured areas should never be rubbed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative practitioners suggest several kinds of\\ntreatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving the\\nhospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or using\\ncontrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con-\\ntrast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold water\\napplications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient can\\nstand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol-\\nlowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. These\\napplications are repeated three times each, ending with the\\ncold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissue\\ngrowth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo-\\npathic and botanical therapies may also assist recovery\\nfrom frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per-\\nforatum) is recommended when nerve ending are affected\\n(especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica\\nmontana) is prescribed for shock. Cayenne pepper (Cap-\\nsicum frutescens) can enhance circulation and relieve pain.\\nDrinking hot ginger (Zingiber officinale) tea also aids cir-\\nculation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture\\nto avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nThe rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment,\\npioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more\\neffective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and\\namputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degree\\nfrostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in\\n1982–85 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss,\\n25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu-\\ntation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatment\\nusing older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly\\n35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although the\\ncomparison group included a higher proportion of sec-\\nond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatment\\nresults was determined to be statistically significant.\\nThe extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf-\\nferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is not\\nthe only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the first\\nweeks or months, people often experience tingling, a\\nburning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from\\nan electric current. Other possible consequences of frost-\\nbite include skin—color changes, nail deformation or\\nloss, joint stiffness and pain,hyperhidrosis (excessive\\nsweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every-\\none, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years—\\nand sometimes a lifetime—is inevitable.\\nPrevention\\nWith the appropriate knowledge and precautions,\\nfrostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most\\nchallenging environments. Appropriate clothing and\\nfootwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep the\\nblood circulating properly, clothing should be worn\\nloosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and head\\nis also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments\\nneed to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing and\\nfootwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco-\\nhol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmful\\neffects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warn\\nagainst alcohol use and smoking in the cold because of\\nthe circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten-\\ntion to the weather report before venturing outdoors and\\navoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolated\\nareas during a blizzard are also important.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBurton Goldberg Group.
